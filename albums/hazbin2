[CHARLIE]
Come on in, here's your key
Let me take your bag, wait 'til you see
The hotel, 'cause it's great
If you parked your car, we'll validate
All our guests are family

[ANGEL DUST, spoken]
Hey, perv, hands off the chest fluff

[CHARLIE]
That's the Hazbin guarantee
And did I mention it's free?

[ALASTOR, spoken]
It's worth the price

[VAGGIE, spoken]
Al, be nice

[HUSK, spoken]
Full of drunks

[CHERRI BOMB, spoken]
Full of cunts

[NIFFTY]
Full of sticky floors covered in junk

[CHARLIE]
Ha, don't mind them

[ANGEL DUST, spoken]
No one does

[CHARLIE]
Or that hole

[VAGGIE, spoken]
Ugh, Cherri

[CHERRI BOMB, spoken]
What?

[CHARLIE]
You've made a great choice to save your soul
'Cause redemption is possible, I really, really hope
'Cause if it isn't, then my whole life's been a fuckin' joke
And my friend died for no reason and I'm never gonna cope
From watching him get fucking murdered right in front of me last month

[BAXTER, spoken]
What?

[CHARLIE]
There's a bar

[HUSK, spoken]
What the shit?

[CHARLIE]
Have a beer

[BAXTER, spoken]
I don't drink

[CHARLIE]
I just know you're gonna love it here

[CHARLIE & VAGGIE]
We can live in harmony

[HUSK, spoken]
No, I can't make a fucking Mai Tai

[CHARLIE & VAGGIE]
That's the Hazbin guarantee

[CHARLIE & HOTEL VISITORS]
Now repeat after me
I'm checkin' in (I'm checkin' in)
I'm seekin' guidance (I'm seekin' guidance), come on, everybody
For my reckonin' (For my reckonin')
I'll never turn to violence (I'll never turn—)
I'm checkin' in (I'm checking in)
I'm seekin' guidance

[HOTEL VISITOR, spoken]
That place sucked ass

[VOX, spoken]
Psst, hey, you

[HOTEL VISITOR, spoken]
Who? Me?

[VOX, spoken]
That's right, baby

[VOX]
Redemption got you snoring? That scene was fucking boring
Have you considered a vocation that is more rewarding?
Because I sense a drop of star potential
With a little boost, that drip could turn torrential

[VELVETTE]
Come on down to Vee Tower where we help talent flower

[VALENTINO]
No tellin' how hot you could get once you're backed by our power

[VELVETTE]
Let's start with a killer fit, let's get filler in those lips

[VALENTINO]
Wax that gooch and pull that strip

[VALENTINO & VELVETTE, VELVETTE]
A-snip, snip, snip
Ooh, all of Hell's gonna want you
In this game, no one outdoes us
No one can outbuzz us

[VALENTINO, VELVETTE & VOX]
All you gotta do is trust us
(La-la-la) Just us
(La-la-la) Trust us

[VOX]
Take all these starring roles

[VALENTINO]
We trademarked all your holes

[VOX & VALENTINO]
There's no such thing as being totally over-exposed

[VELVETTE]
Except now they're sick of you 'cause they've seen way too much
But we'll still get the clicks from souls who hate you

[VOX]
Scratch that, they changed the channel
And we can't sell the scandal
Hope you had fun, but we are done with you
Your run is cancelled
We're finished, I'm not kidding
Get the fuck out of my building
Get the fuck out of my building

[VALENTINO & VELVETTE, VALENTINO]
Snip, snip, snip, bitch
Ooh
But if you know someone new
Tell 'em that no one outdoes us
No one can outbuzz us
All they gotta do is—

[CHARLIE, VOX, VALENTINO & VELVETTE]
Come on in (Come on down to Vee Tower)
Here's your key

[CHARLIE, VOX, VALENTINO & VELVETTE]
And see how great your afterlife could be

[CHARLIE]
We can live in harmony

[VALENTINO & VELVETTE]
Why be nice when you can be famous?

[VOX]
Yeah, right, bitch
Trust me, just me
Trust—

Us, no, I—
I meant to say us

[VELVETTE, spoken]
Uh-huh

[VALENTINO, spoken]
Yeah, okay
?== Once We Get Up There
[VOX]
It's not what Heaven is
It's what it could be
With new management in charge
Like you, and you, and me

Once we get up there and snag that angelic throne
Our unholy trinity could make their realm our own
We'll pack up all their piety, and redecorate
Bet our tower would look powerful with pearlier gates

Once we get up there, up to the promised land
A hundred billion souls await our every command
We're the biggest fish in Hell, how 'bout we upgrade the bowl?
It's time for growth, let's rule 'em both, take total control

Think of all your dreams that could come true

[VALENTINO]
Even the wet ones?

[VOX]
Yeah, those too!
Imagine what it could enable

[VELVETTE]
For my label

[VOX]
Yes!
A heavenly host that bows to none but us

[VALENTINO]
I can have hot new angel sluts

[VELVETTE]
Tear off their wings and make 'em dresses!

[VOX, VELVETTE & VALENTINO]
And what's best is

[VELVETTE]
That dumb princess showed us the way

[VALENTINO]
To make those haloed cabronas pay

[VOX]
And once we're gods, I can't wait to say
To everyone who doubted me, your doubting days are done
You'll be cornered, trapped, and tortured
Then I'll end you, just for fun

Once we get up there
The shining kingdom of God
No more petty squabbles with the dead
As we stroll the golden promenade

[VOX, VELVETTE & VALENTINO]
What's an overlord to a deity?
They ain't got a prayer

[VELVETTE]
It'll be so nice in paradise

[VALENTINO]
With a splash of vice, they'll pay the price

[VOX, VELVETTE & VALENTINO]
We'll rule the sky from up on high

[VOX, VALENTINO, VELVETTE, ALL]
Once I (And I) (And I) get up there

[VOX, spoken]
They're fucked!
?== Like You
[EMILY]
You're gonna make so many new friends here
Potential amigos around every corner
No bullies or bums, the chums are tens here
It'll be a breezy piece of cake to form your
Brand new squad, crew, or clique
If you want some buddies, you'll have your pick

'Cause no one here is like you
Not one remotely like you
You've got mystique, you're strange and unique
You'll make pals come hither with every hiss and slither
Everyone will like you 'cause no one here is like you

[EMILY & ABEL]
Scented candles, ponies, marshmallow discotheques

[SIR PENTIOUS, spoken]
Do you have enriched uranium?

[EMILY & ABEL]
No! But we got a unicorn polo stadium

[SAINT PETER]
Christmas romcoms all year long at the Multi-plex

[ABEL, spoken]
I'm in love with you, Santa Claus

[EMILY, ABEL & SAINT PETER, spoken]
Five stars!

[EMILY, ABEL & SAINT PETER]
And no one here's addicted to crack

[SIR PENTIOUS]
I'll get back to my friends
Once I gradate the voltage and calibrate this lens
I will find a way
To quantize this frequency, updrive the peak speed
So I can see them today

[EMILY, ABEL & SAINT PETER, SIR PENTIOUS, spoken]
No one here schemes like you (I'm coming, Cherri!)
Sheds skin or blasphemes like you (I'll see you in Hell!)
In no time, we shall become your best pals

[SIR PENTIOUS, spoken]
Ah, shit

[EMILY, spoken]
Yeah, I forgot to mention
You're not able to leave
But look on the bright side

[EMILY]
We'll have so much fun here
From now 'til kingdom come here

[EMILY & ABEL, SIR PENTIOUS, spoken, SAINT PETER]
We literally will (No, no, no, no, no)
Have forever to chill (No!) (Come on!)

[EMILY & ABEL, SAINT PETER]
You'll soon know us too well (Oh-woah)
Since you can't go back to Hell (Yeah, yeah)
So wave your lonely days bye

[EMILY, ABEL & SAINT PETER]
You big, weird, lonely snake guy
Beagles, sprinkles, friendship
Guinea pigs, churros, pangolins
Everyone will like you 'cause no one here is like you

[EMILY, spoken]
Ooh, maybe that didn't help actually
?== Sera’s Confession
[SERA]
I don't know what to do
Thought I was righteously leading our people, but
Now I'm faced with the truth
What kind of leader can't tell good from evil?
All those poor souls, how many could have been saved?
How could I trust in a justice so cruel and depraved?

[SPEAKER OF GOD]
One seeks an answer that one can not grant her
You're looking for light only you can ignite
Every transgression must serve as a lesson
Yesterday, you drew sorrow
What will you do tomorrow?

[SERA & SPEAKER OF GOD]
I feel no wiser than when I commanded the slaughter of those sons and daughters
(You can't hide)
How can I be sure I don't repeat more massacre based on mistaken conceit?
(Look inside)
If I stand down and leave us exposed, would that be blind to the threat Hell may pose?

[SPEAKER OF GOD]
You can't know, though time flows on
So you must bear the cross bestowed upon you

[SERA]
Take pity, I pray
Give me a sign, what's your guidance?
Please show me the way

[SPEAKER OF GOD & SERA]
You speak of choices made by other voices
You can only atone (Tell me how to atone)
Once you speak with your own

[SERA]
If souls from damnation
Can earn their salvation
And find their forgiveness on high
How do I?
?== Gravity
[LUTE, ADAM & BOTH]
(Sanctus) Does no one know who they're dealin' with?
Think I'll let it go? Forget and forgive? (Dominus)
The rage in me (Yeah?) is terminal (Yeah?)
There's no remedy (Yeah?) but to burn 'em all (Ignis)

[LUTE]
I still got a job to do, my mission's incomplete
Only a traitor could consider making peace (Vindictus)

[LUTE & ADAM]
The princess has to pay
For what she did that day

[LUTE]
For what she took away

[LUTE & ADAM]
Storm's comin', I can see the clouds
No runnin's gonna save you now
And hard rain is gonna fall down
Like gravity, like gravity

[LUTE]
Eye for an eye says you owe me a debt
Blood demands blood, gonna get my hands wet

[LUTE & ADAM]
The flood's comin', now you can bet on tragedy
Like gravity

[LUTE]
(Sanctus) You think you're Hell's great savior (Dominus)
Will you still when I return the favor? (Ignis)
Take the one you need, make you watch 'em bleed (Vindictus)
Will you break thinkin' how you couldn't save her?

Wishin' you were there when they needed you
The only soul who's ever completed you
Maybe then, you'll get a little heated too
And understand why this is what I need to do

Storm's comin', I can see the clouds
(Sanctus Dominus)

[LUTE & ADAM]
No runnin's gonna save you now
And hard rain is gonna fall down
Like gravity, like gravity

[LUTE, ADAM & BOTH]
Eye for an eye says you owe me a debt (Yeah)
Blood demands blood, gonna get my hands wet (Get your hands wet)

[LUTE & ADAM]
The flood's comin', now you can bet on tragedy
Like gravity (Gravitas)
?== Piss (A Love Song)
[SIR PENTIOUS]
These Elysian nights
Alone in the golden skies
Lost in a memory of how it used to be
When it was only you and me
And our old petty slights
I found home in those messy fights
Somehow, I couldn't see through the cloud of debris
At the scene of the crime

They say time heals all wounds
But the wounds are what I miss
'Cause every brush with death
Meant much more than a kiss

[CHERRI BOMB]
Can you hear me callin'
From way the fuck down here?
Those golden days of brawlin'
Were the best of all my years

I'm bored as fuck without you
Are you bored without me too?
I'm longing for just one night more
Of beating the piss out of you

[CHERRI BOMB, SIR PENTIOUS & EGG BOIZ]
Turf war, what's the score?
How the hell'd she get on board?
Egg Boiz, kill that vandal
Hope you like your minions scrambled
Oh shit
Get lit
Get your punk-ass off my ship
If you say so, gotta go
Oh my God, it's gonna blow

[CHERRI BOMB]
Another exciting Sin City night
This Sheila's blastin' your ass away

[SIR PENTIOUS]
Glorious bloodshed under neon lights
I will destroy you at last

[SIR PENTIOUS & CHERRI BOMB]
They say time heals all wounds
But the wounds are what I miss
And every brush with death
Meant much more than a kiss

[SIR PENTIOUS & CHERRI BOMB, BOTH]
Can you feel me fallin'?
Though I don't know if it's love (Could this be love?)
The cuts are healed and scarrin'
But I still taste the blood (I still taste your blood)
I know I tried to kill you
And you tried to kill me too

[SIR PENTIOUS & CHERRI BOMB]
You blew a hole right through my soul
While I was beating the piss out of you
Beating the piss

[CHERRI BOMB]
Out of you
?== Speedrun To Redemption
[VOX, spoken]
Alright, show me redemption

[CHARLIE]
Step one, say you'll get it done
Make redemption your resolution

[ANGEL DUST, spoken]
Fine

[CHARLIE]
Step two, bid the booze adieu

[ANGEL DUST, spoken]
Hey!

[CHARLIE]
A sober mind's primed for absolution
Step three, dignity!
Try dressing more modestly
Step four, feed the poor

[HOMELESS DEMON]
Hey, ain't you that fancy whore?

[CHARLIE]
Five, six, seven, eight
Come on, buddy, concentrate
Change some babies, and
Help old ladies across the street
Isn't he sweet?

[VOX, spoken, VELVETTE, spoken]
Uh-huh (Right)

[CHARLIE, ANGEL DUST, spoken]
Come on, Angel, you're far from shameful
Just misunderstood
You can be good for good (Woah)
All you skeptics, pay close attention
We'll speedrun from here to redemption

Step nine, give a hobo a dime

[VOX, spoken, VELVETTE, spoken]
Yeah, no way, this story is bogus (Haha)

[CHARLIE]
Step ten, do one through nine again

[ANGEL  DUST, spoken]
Again?

[CHARLIE]
Just in case the angels in charge didn't notice
Step eleven—

[VOX, spoken]
Little question, this guy gets to Heaven how?

[CHARLIE]
Step twelve, what the hell?
Pentious was redeemed by now
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen
Better, nicer, faster, quickly

Wear this top hat, and build a rocket
You gotta commit, start speaking like this
Have depression, an egg obsession
And a leathery hood, then you'll be good for good
Then save a friend from a certain demise—, oh, fuck!
Maybe the key is self-sacrifice
If you offer up your life with pure intentions
We'll speedrun from here to redemption

[ANGEL DUST, spoken]
I hate you
?== Don’t You Forget
[ROSIE]
Sounds like you really could do
With a little reminder of who you're talking to
An honest woman
Always there to lend an ear
I dealt with you fairly, been patient, it's true
But remember, my deer
You're in my zoo

Don't you forget
You are my pet
I say when to sit and stay
Roll over, or go fetch
Don't you forget
There's no way out
You're a debtor 'til the day you settle your account

[ALASTOR]
I've served you faithfully for an age
Obeyed demands, contained my rage
Went off the air for years on your behalf

[ROSIE, spoken]
I know, and you're so kind

[ALASTOR]
And since you made me disappear
My name inspires much less fear
The least that you can do is fix my staff

[ROSIE, spoken]
In due time
Sing along, dear, you know the words

[ROSIE, ALASTOR & BOTH]
Don't you forget (I won't forget)
You are my pet (Yours since we met)
I say when to sit and stay
Play ball, or just play dead
Don't you forget (I'm in your net)
The coop can't be flown (At least, not yet)
The moves you make are mine and mine alone
Looks like you'll have to do this on your own (Looks like I'll have to do this on my own)

[ALASTOR, spoken]
Fine
?== Don’t You Forget (Reprise)
[VOX]
You think your little mockery is gonna make me cwy?
That I'm bawlin' 'bout the past that could have been?
Look around ya, Al!
I've been schemin' this whole time
I got a team, I got a dream
And all I'm gonna do is win!

You're in my house, with my rules
In my room, with my tools
And worse, you're at my mercy
Cursed to watch me take it all
You've gone ass up
You're deep fried
Your last luck has run dry
At last, your check has cashed
I'd laugh at how you look so small

Don't you forget
You're on my string
You can try to squirm and struggle and it wouldn't do a thing
Don't you forget!

[ALASTOR]
You're so obsessed with me
I knew you'd need me here to be
Your unwilling audience
When you lose your marbles in act three

[VOX]
You're huffing glue if you think I won't end this tale a ruler
I'm just like you except I'm smarter, sharper, brighter, newer!
So, I'll keep your smug ass alive to—

[ALASTOR, spoken]
To show me you're not a loser?

[VOX, spoken]
Do you ever shut up?

[ALASTOR & VOX, spoken]
Don't you forget (Oh, here he goes)
You ain't won yet (Ooh, I'm scared)
You still need me like you did before

[VOX, spoken]
So cute you think I care

[VOX]
Now I'm the master
And you're my bottomest bitch
No more Al, the high and mighty
Now that I flipped the switch
Though the radio's gone dead
You know the show must go on
By the time I've had my fun
You'll wish that you had stayed gone!

[VALENTINO, spoken]
Hey, you two should just fuck already
?== Bad With Us
[ZEEZI]
Holy shit, is this true?
Alastor's been defeated?

[OVERLORD, ZEEZI]
By Lucifer? (No!)

[OVERLORD]
Then who?

[ZEEZI]
That self-absorbed TV head

[MAESTRO]
Word is, he gut him fair and square

[ZEEZI]
I heard Vox fucked him with a chair

[ZEEZI, MAESTRO & OTHER OVERLORD]
Either way, it's seemin' the Radio Demon's off the air

[PRICK]
I can't remember ever seein' power shift this fast

[PRICK & HATCHET]
With all his smarmy talk, I thought Vox was just gassed up

[OVERLORD]
Now he's surpassed all expectations

[ZEEZI]
Hell as we know it is through, he's shaken the foundations

[ZEEZI, MAESTRO, PRICK, HATCHET & OTHER OVERLORDS]
Now that Vox's muscles are flexed

[ZEEZI]
Who knows what moves those Vees will make next?

[VOX]
So I've had a stroke of luck, it's true
But I'm not one to rest on my laurels
What better time to reinforce our crew?
Grab an olive branch, go knock on some door-els
Why should we keep crossing swords?
After all, we're all overlords

[VOX, VALENTINO & VELVETTE]
You know you wanna be bad with us (Bad with us)
Come and make angels mad with us (So mad with us)
And Zeezi?

[VOX]
I hear that Heaven has some pretty sick venues
Open a club up, make a hubbub, drop a beat to amen to
Hey, Prick and Hatchet, best believe your gang fights are gonna be batshit
With exorcist blades, you can fill Heaven with rage
Oh, Maestro, I know a tranquil realm where you can rest
Hey, Zestial, there's old, boring shit up there
Books, tea, elder care
Mi querida, Carmilla

[CARMILLA CARMINE, spoken]
Are you serious?

[VOX, spoken]
Mm, yeah, okay, mm-mm

[VOX]
It's the dawn of a new regime
Come on, join the winning team

[ZEEZI]
It's so much fun to be—

[VOX, VALENTINO, VELVETTE, ZEEZI, MAESTRO, PRICK, HATCHET & OTHER OVERLORDS]
Bad with us
So bad with us (So fuckin' bad with us)

[VOX]
Cha-cha-cha

[VELVETTE, spoken]
No!

[VALENTINO, spoken]
Stop it
?== VOX POPULI
[LUCIFER]
You're actin' out like you want teacher's attention
Well, I'm the principal of this eternal detention
I hope you had your fun, but, son, it's time to ring the bell, ha, ding-ding
Sinnerman, you're gettin' way too big for your screen
Now I'm here to drop your punishment, it's gonna be mean
Just in case y'all had forgotten who's the motherfuckin' king of Hell

'Cause I'm the serpent, I'm the flame
The mortal world is scared to say my name
I am so spooky, I'm the shit
I am a living aspect of the infinite
So, scheme all you want, Mr. TV-Head-Man
I'm nearly a god, who are you?
Just a dead man

[VOX, spoken]
Wow, super scary
I see why they give you such a big hat
Quick thing, though

[VOX]
It's curious you stopped by to fight me nail and tooth
When all I mean to try, is to dispense a dose of truth
We sinners do not need a king, we need someone who understands
A different kind of despot bringing respite from divine demands
New order, like what Lilith had envisioned when she threatened them
She knew Hell could be great
And we can make Hell great again

Just imagine if we could flip the script
Take the fight back way upstairs, and
Make 'em beg and say their prayers, and
What would happen if we could run the ship?
Hoist the mainsail, paint the decks

[CROWD]
Aye-aye

[VOX, CROWD, VOX & CROWD]
Have a crewmate to protect, 'cause
They want us all divided
That is how they keep us down
We got the guts (Guts)
We got the chutzpah (Chutzpah)
We got the means to seize the crown (Yeah)
If you're not fuckin' stupid, then you've only got one choice
Me, Vox Populi, the People's voice

[VOX, CROWD]
Try to picture if we could escape this hole (Let's go)
Never have to live in fear of days that angels may appear, 'cause
Here's the kicker, sinners can save their souls
Not by changing for redemption, but by taking over Heaven
They say Hell's too populated, that's why they exterminate
We got the numbers, we got the thunder
Let's annex their real estate (Yeah)
If you wanna see a new world, raise your fist and make some noise
Hail Vox Populi, the People's voice

[VOX]
Manifest destiny, long as you invest in me
The rest'll all fit into place

[VOX, spoken]
Meanwhile, this king thinks all of us peasants
Should be satisfied with an endless existence of suffering

[LUCIFER, spoken]
Woah-woah, wait, wait, hold on

[VOX, spoken]
Tell me, Hell, are you satisfied?
Your wife knew it was wrong, Lu
Maybe that's why she's not around anymore

[LUCIFER, spoken]
You mouthy little mortal

[VOX, spoken]
Here it comes
Smite me, silence me
That's all you angels know how to do
You won't do it, you're weak
They didn't banish you, they clipped your wings and chained you down here
Well, I got no chains on me
Who's with me?

[CROWD, VOX]
Let's unite and fight for a brand new realm (Brand new realm)
We'll direct our destinies as one nation under Vees (I love it)
'Cause, happy days are nigh with Vox at the helm (That's me)
Future's never tasted sweeter (Oh, yeah)
Thanks to our charming leader
Every sinner can be a winner
Let's take our fates to the Pearly Gates
We can have the keys if we trust the Vees
Give applause, Hell has cause to rejoice

[VOX & CROWD]
Hail Vox Populi, the People's voice
?== VOX DEI
[VOX, spoken]
This angel admits it
She called the extermination to silence the sinners speaking out
Empowering each other
You did it to keep us down

[VOX]
Well, we are not gonna be kept down anymore
Consider this a declaration of holy war
I've woken up the people to the lies you angels tell
When we pay you a visit, we won't be bringing baskets
We'll be bringing decimation that'll put you in caskets
I'll show you what it means to be the motherfuckin' king of Hell

[VOX, CROWD]
'Cause I'm the furor, I'm immense (Praise Vox)
I am the avatar of your consequence (Praise Vox)
I'm your omega, I'm the flood (Praise Vox)
I am the nightmare you made when you spilled our blood (Praise Vox)

[VOX]
So cower and hide, find a rope you can swing from
Go say your goodbyes, to your lives, to your kingdom
?== Love In A Bottle
[HUSK, spoken]
Now, this is where I'm meant to be

[HUSK]
You know, it's been such a long time since I've been out on my own
Bittersweet, to be so free and so alone
It kinda feels like the wrong time to feel sorry for myself
Makes you wanna drink 'til you feel like you are someone else
Then another
Then another, and another, and another, and another

[HUSKETTES]
Love in a bottle, love in a bottle
Don't need love when it comes in a bottle
Strut when you're bluffin', double or nothin'
Lap it up, laugh it up, la, la, la, la

[HUSK]
Get the top shelf, double rocks, pour the Scotch
I've missed the tune of tumblers clinking
Deal me in, kick the sin up a notch
Divin' in quicksand's faster than sinkin'
I'm leavin' behind all of the cares that I've been overthinkin'
Find friends in my wine
Stay unaware's just as long as I'm drinking

[HUSK & HUSKETTES]
Love in a bottle, love in a bottle
Don't need love when it comes in a bottle
Strut when you're bluffin', double or nothin'
Lap it up, laugh it up, la, la, la, la

[HUSK]
Love is in the ice of the beholder
Gin never lies or fucks you over
It goes down the same every time
You need someone to hand your chips
Go all in and abandon ship
You're jumpin' for the water, and it's all 100 proof

[HUSK & HUSKETTES]
Love in a bottle, love in a bottle
Don't need love when it comes in a bottle
Strut when you're bluffin', double or nothin'
Lap it up, laugh it up, la, la, la, la

[HUSK]
Love in a bottle, love in a bottle
Can't have love when it comes in a bottle
Home in a bottle, numb in a bottle
I don't need nothin' that's not from a bottle
Another round!
?== Losin’ Streak
[ANGEL DUST]
It's been so very long
Since Lady Luck kissed you
Still, you listen for her song
And pray that she missed you

Dead inside
'Cause you know it's all pretend
Close your eyes
'Cause you're goin' off the deep end again

You're livin' for the rush
For that royal flush
But you take what you can get
You play your final ace
For a pretty face
Tastes like Scotch and cigarettes
And you can't help fallin'
Goin' all in
Though your odds are bleak
'Til you break your losin' streak

Ooh
Oh, no

You're livin' for the rush
For that royal flush
But the next best thing will do
You want to spend your chips
On these rosy lips
Tryin' to get me next to you
'Cause you can't help needin'
To believe in
Findin' what you seek
'Til you break your losin'

[ANGEL DUST, spoken]
Good luck out there, boys
?== Easy
[VAGGIE]
Shut up, you know that I love you
But that's enough of this spiral
Some of your dreams haven't come true
Well, here's how we'll break the cycle

Your hand, my hand
Your body and mine
They can withstand the firin' line

'Cause anyone who finds love in Hell can do anything, baby
You and me don't need no one else to make it through the crazy
No blow comes close to fatal for this princess and fallen angel
We already found love in Hell, the rest is easy, baby

[CHARLIE & VAGGIE]
I appreciate all that (We'll get through it)
But we need our friends to come back (We can do it)

[CHARLIE]
You're my pillar, my heart's fulfiller
But there's no way this lining's silver
Everyone's gone, we're facing a war
We can't get in touch with anyone anymore, and—

[VAGGIE]
Shut up, you know that I love you
But you're forgettin' who we are
In a pit that doesn't let sun through
Somehow we managed to see stars

[CHARLIE & VAGGIE, CHARLIE]
Your heart, my heart, when I am with you
Two souls, one goal, we'll never lose (Woah)

'Cause anyone who finds love in Hell can do anything, baby
You and me don't need no one else to make it through the crazy
No blow comes close to fatal for this princess and fallen angel
We already found love in Hell, the rest is easy, baby

[VAGGIE & CHARLIE]
Anyone who finds love in Hell can do anything, baby (Easy)
You and me don't need no one else to make it through the crazy

[CHARLIE & VAGGIE]
No blow comes close to fatal for this princess and fallen angel
We already found love in Hell, the rest is easy, baby
?== Brighter
[VINCENT, spoken]
That's it for today
And remember, trust us with your weather!

[VOX]
Rome wasn't built in a day
You gotta climb a little higher, to the top of the display
Where there's a will, there's a way
You just gotta slit a throat or two to make the weak obey

[VINCENT, spoken]
Today, we mourn the loss of one of our own
But our commitment to the truth is as strong as ever
Remember, trust us with your news

[VOX]
If you want it, just take it
The world's yours, don't waste it
Go make the stars align, to shine brighter
Brighter than the heavens in the skies above (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You'll be brighter, goin' supernova, all the eyes look up (At you, at you)
Brighter

[VINCENT, spoken]
And a big thank you to my producers for giving me this chance
I know I have some mighty big shoes to fill
But I promise, you can trust me
With your entertainment

[VOX]
It's not a shot in the dark, not up to chance
If you got plans, you'll cancel every question mark
Fish like to swim next to sharks
Yeah, you eat or you get eaten
And you're feastin' on their hearts

[VINCENT, spoken]
They're calling me a god, Bob!
You gotta strike while the iron's hot
Leave the channel to me
I'll bring in more new blood than you'll know what to do with
Come on! Trust me with your network

[VOX]
To shine brighter
Brighter than the heavens in the skies above (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You'll be brighter
Goin' supernova, all the eyes look up (At you, at you)
Brighter!

[VINCENT, spoken]
The other studios wanna feed you the same old crap everyone's seen before
You want newer, you want bigger, you want brighter
I will be your voice, and we will redefine what it means to rule the airwaves
Trust me, and your future will be brighter
Now who's ready to be baptized into a new era of entertainment?

[VOX]
Brighter

Finally, I'll show them what I'm meant to be (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Brighter)
They won't believe their eyes when I bring them to their knees
To worship me
Brighter!
?== Live To Live
[SIR PENTIOUS]
Humans are afraid
All of us, all the time
Mortality's a blade
Swinging with no reason, no rhyme
When you're that scared
Teeth are that bared
Ready to say anything, do any sin to any man

Just so you can live to see a ray of sunshine
Through the haze of the morning ether
Live to fail a million times
Until you finally yell, "Eureka!"
Praying you find a way, make it another day
See your dreams through
Some would kill to live to
Live again tomorrow

[SERA, SIR PENTIOUS, spoken]
In the battle with Adam, you feared your death (Yes)
But fear didn't drive you to wickedness
And you were brave, you sacrificed
Yourself to save another's life
Something had changed in you, deep within
How does a guilty soul shed their sin?

[SIR PENTIOUS]
It starts with "sorry"
Though it cannot just end there
I learned from Charlie
First, you must prove you care
Mistakes are innate to being human and alive
We fall, we repent, we survive

[SERA & SIR PENTIOUS]
There's hope for us all as we strive
To live to earn my own redemption (It starts with "sorry")
Lead the realms to a better new day
Live to end the cosmic tension (It starts with Charlie)
Pursue a peace before it's too late

[SERA, SERA & SIR PENTIOUS]
If it prevents the fight, then I must make things right
That's what I'll do so no one kills to
Live to
Live again tomorrow
?== When I Think About The Future
[CHARLIE]
When I think about the future, I see a better place
Where everyone can coexist safely

[VAGGIE]
When I think about the future, I see my favorite face
'Cause when I'm with you, the rest is all easy, baby

[CHARLIE & VAGGIE]
Hand in hand, we'll make them understand our dream
Working as a team

[BAXTER]
If we plot the right maneuvers, we'll chart a course to win

[CHERRI BOMB]
And blow up any cunts who would fight us
Fuck, yeah

[EMILY, NIFFTY]
Wish that I had seen it sooner, but it's time that we begin (Stab, stab)

[CHARLIE & EMILY]
To prevent the war and find a way to unite us

[HUSK & BAXTER]
These overlords are tough, but with our expertise

[HUSK, BAXTER, NIFFTY, VAGGIE, CHERRI BOMB & EMILY]
We can stop the Vees

[NIFFTY, CHARLIE & EMILY, spoken]
Yeah!

[VOX]
Soon I'll be up there, the one and only true god
No more playin' house, once they're devout, I won't need a squad
Climb the stairway up to Heaven, live on every TV
Always knew the guy they're prayin' to was gonna be me
Once I get up there

[ALASTOR]
You will fuck it up

[VOX]
Just watch

[ALASTOR]
You'll never fill your cup
You're broken from the start, no victory will ever be enough

[VOX]
We'll see who's smiling in the end, I won't even gloat
You can say your last "I told you so" while I slit your throat

[VALENTINO]
Val, don't be dramatic
He's just a man
He's being rude 'cause he's stressed out trying to do his master plan
Think about the future, Val, don't let success break up the band
But as he rises higher, things aren't like they were before
And if he glows any brighter, will he see me anymore?

[VELVETTE]
Vox is an asshole

[VALENTINO, spoken]
Right?

[VELVETTE]
He's bein' a cunt

[VALENTINO, spoken]
He's being such a dick

[VELVETTE]
If he thinks that he can cut us out
Fuck him, just bein' blunt
Once we rule all creation, he'll pay for this little stunt
And maybe then he'll chill again and realize who he missed

[VALENTINO & VELVETTE]
Now let's show those stuck-up pricks in Heaven who's the baddest bitch

[LUCIFER]
Uh, what's going on?
How'd I get stuck in this scary box?
Oh, boy, this is bad
Charlie's gonna be so mad

[LUTE]
They're about to know who they're dealin' with
Every one of them, no one gets to live

[ABEL]
Is my halo on? I'm gonna shit my pants

[LUTE]
What the fuck is wrong? This battle is our chance

[LUTE & ABEL]
Storm's coming

[ABEL]
I'm so fuckin' scared
What's gonna happen when we go down there?

[LUTE]
You don't deserve your dad's crown

[ABEL]
I know there's no stopping it now

[LUTE & ABEL]
A hard rain is gonna fall down
Like gravity, like gravity

[SERA]
When I think about the future, my mind is filled with dread
A screaming conscience I cannot silence
And I cannot outmaneuver these visions in my head
Of the deaths to come, the realms drowned in crushing violence
I tried to buy us time, but could I have done more
To quell the drums of war?
And I try to still my heartbeat
For the breaking of the dawn
And pray the coming day's not our last one
?== Hear My Hope
[EMILY]
Hear my hope
Let it echo
In every soul that needs
Something to believe

[EMILY & CHARLIE]
Take my hand
Never let go
Even one soft sound can shake the hardest ground
And even if we die striving to find the peace we lost
At least we'll know we tried, didn't stand by with fingers crossed

[EMILY, CHARLIE & HUSK]
Raise your voice, light the fire
'Til our hopes and fears reach a billion ears

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK & NIFFTY]
Lend your breath, join the choir
Let the music span o'er this broken land

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK, NIFFTY & VAGGIE]
And many years from now, if any live to hear this song

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK, NIFFTY, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, CHERRI BOMB & BAXTER]
A story about how all Hell joined hands and sang along
It begins with just one note
A crescendo 'til the end, no matter what it takes to stay afloat
Hear my hope

[LUTE, spoken]
Hahahaha
Hahahaha (Sanctus)

[VAGGIE]
What are you doing here?

[LUTE]
I'm here to finish what I started

[ABEL]
Let's get Emily and go

[CHARLIE]
No, how can you be so cold-hearted? (Dominus)

[VAGGIE]
Everybody dies if we don't do this

[LUTE]
And so be it, don't persist

[VAGGIE]
Or what?

[LUTE]
I'll take your other eye

[VAGGIE]
Just try

[ABEL]
Lute, this isn't what we talked about (Ignis)

[EMILY]
Abel, please

[CHARLIE]
We don't have time for this

[LUTE]
Shut your mouth, abomination

[VAGGIE]
Abel, you can stop this

[CHARLIE, spoken]
Abel?

[EMILY, spoken]
Abel, breathe

[LUTE, spoken]
Enough

[ABEL]
Can't breathe, vision's gettin' blurry now
Nosebleed, never been so worried
How'm I s'posed to handle the pressure?
It would've been better if I were anybody else
Dear dad, tell me what you would've done
Too bad that I'm not your braver son
Why'd I have to be picked to lead?
I wish that I could be anybody else

I'm supposed to do something
Am I, am I supposed to do something?
Do I run, do I dare, can I grant my own prayer?
Get a grip, grow a pair

[ABEL & ADAM]
Let me stop you right there
There's no cause for attack
Swallow your pride, cast your bloodlust aside
Bitch, you better fall back

[EMILY, spoken]
I can't hold it much longer

[CHARLIE, spoken]
We got you

[VAGGIE]
We need to be stronger

[HUSK]
We've done all we can, there's no way

[NIFFTY & ANGEL DUST]
No way

[CHERRI BOMB]
No one left to save the day

[CHARLIE]
It's okay

[CARMILLA CARMINE]
You would risk your life

[ZESTIAL]
For souls that Heaven sought to kill?

[CARMILLA CARMINE & ZESTIAL]
We can not just stand by
It's time to match your strength of will

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK, NIFFTY, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, CHERRI BOMB, BAXTER, CARMILLA CARMINE, ZESTIAL, ZEEZI, MAESTRO, PRICK & HATCHET, SINNERS]
Hear my hope (Save us from harm)
Let it echo
In every soul that needs (Lay down our arms)
Something to believe
Take my hand (Just for a day)
Never let go
Even one soft sound (Put war away)
Can shake the hardest ground

[ROSIE]
Why don't you help them, you double-dealing manipulator?

[ALASTOR]
What's in it for me? I don't work for free
You want help, well, you know the fee

[ROSIE]
I will not reward a snake like you

[ALASTOR]
You'll watch them die unless you do

[ROSIE]
Liar, you wouldn't dare

[ALASTOR]
Quid pro quo, it's only fair

[ROSIE]
You really are a demon, pet

[ALASTOR]
You knew my game the day we met

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK, NIFFTY, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, CHERRI BOMB, BAXTER, CARMILLA CARMINE, ZESTIAL, ZEEZI, MAESTRO, PRICK, HATCHET, ALASTOR & ROSIE]
Hear my hope
Let it thunder
Across this prideful ring
'Til every last soul sings

[VELVETTE, spoken]
Ah, fuck it, come on

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK, NIFFTY, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, CHERRI BOMB, BAXTER, CARMILLA CARMINE, ZESTIAL, ZEEZI, MAESTRO, PRICK, HATCHET, ALASTOR & ROSIE, VALENTINO & VELVETTE]
Take my hand (We'll take your hand)
Feel the wonder

[VOX, spoken]
Wait, what?

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK, NIFFTY, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, CHERRI BOMB, BAXTER, CARMILLA CARMINE, ZESTIAL, ZEEZI, MAESTRO, PRICK, HATCHET, ALASTOR & ROSIE, VALENTINO & VELVETTE]
In perfect harmony (Not what we planned)
We'll change our destiny

[VOX, spoken]
What the fuck is happening?

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK, NIFFTY, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, CHERRI BOMB, BAXTER, CARMILLA CARMINE, ZESTIAL, ZEEZI, MAESTRO, PRICK, HATCHET, ALASTOR & ROSIE, VALENTINO & VELVETTE]
And many years from now
If any live to hear this song (If we live)

[VOX, spoken]
Stop it right now

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK, NIFFTY, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, CHERRI BOMB, BAXTER, CARMILLA CARMINE, ZESTIAL, ZEEZI, MAESTRO, PRICK, HATCHET, ALASTOR & ROSIE]
The story about how we learned, together, we are strong

[VOX, spoken]
No, no-no-no, no, no

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK, NIFFTY, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, CHERRI BOMB, BAXTER, CARMILLA CARMINE, ZESTIAL, ZEEZI, MAESTRO, PRICK, HATCHET, ALASTOR, ROSIE, VALENTINO & VELVETTE]
It began with just one note

[VOX, spoken]
Stop it, I hate this

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK, NIFFTY, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, CHERRI BOMB, BAXTER, CARMILLA CARMINE, ZESTIAL, ZEEZI, MAESTRO, PRICK, HATCHET, ALASTOR, ROSIE, VALENTINO & VELVETTE]
A crescendo 'til the end, no matter what it takes

[VOX, spoken]
You're ruining everything

[ALL OF HELL]
Hear my hope
