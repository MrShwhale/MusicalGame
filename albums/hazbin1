?== Happy Day In Hell
[CHARLIE:]
I can do this, somehow I know it
I'll get Heaven behind my plans

[VAGGIE:]
Charlie, hold on

[CHARLIE:]
There's just no way I could blow it
Not this once-in-a-lifetime chance

[VAGGIE:]
It's just a meeting

[CHARLIE:]
To change their mind and touch their hearts
Or whatever angels have

[VAGGIE:]
This could be bad

[CHARLIE:]
Cheer up, Vaggie
This could be swell
Something tells me that today will be a happy day in Hell

[VAGGIE:]
Okay, but just don't... sing to them

[ANGEL DUST:]
That bitch is halfway down the street

[VAGGIE:]
Is she...

[ANGEL DUST:]
Oh, she's dancin'

[VAGGIE:]
Ugh, no

[CHARLIE:]
There's a warm, fuzzy feeling that wafts through the air
Every street so revealing, it's hard not to stare
It's a realm so appealing, it beats anywhere
If you don't mind the smell
It's a happy day in Hell

[CHARLIE:]
Hi, mister!

[DEMON:]
Go fuck yourself!

[SINNER:]
There's an endless trash fire that's burning my soul

[CHARLIE:]
Hello!

[IMP:]
Got a ton of barbed wire to shove in his hole

[CHARLIE:]
Oh, excuse me!

[EXECUTIONER:]
Doing what is required, we all have our role

[SINNER:]
I'm not doing well

[DEMONS:]
Another shitty day in Hell

[CHARLIE:]
If I can show them the dream I've dreamed
That any soul can change

[VAGGIE:]
Those angels' minds are hard to change

[CHARLIE:]
Then they will know everyone can be redeemed
From the evil to the strange

[VAGGIE:]
They're bloodthirsty and deranged!

[CHARLIE:]
I can hear all their stories, the lost and displaced
And I know that they're more of an acquired taste
But if I open the door and I give them a place
At my Hazbin Hotel
It'll be a happy day in Hell

[CHARLIE:]
From the porn studio, where the cinephiles go
To watch award-winning demon bukkake shows
To the Cannibal Town, where they don't wear a frown
'Cause holy shit, oh my gosh, why?
And I don't give a crow that his brains got in my eye!
'Cause I know I can spare them from Heaven's genocide

[CHARLIE (SINNERS):]
I can do this I just know it
(There's an endless trash fire that's burning my soul)
I'll get Heaven behind my plan
There's just no way I could blow it
(I kinda like the barbed wire that's shoved in my hole)
Not this once-in-a-lifetime chance to change their minds...

[TRENCH COAT DEMON:]
And touch my parts

[CHARLIE:]
Uh, no thank you, I'm just gonna...
Fulfill my destiny!

[TRENCH COAT DEMON:]
Your loss, bitch

[CHARLIE:]
I can already tell
Today is gonna be a fuckin' happy day in Hell 
?== Hell Is Forever
[CHARLIE:]
Okay, I've got a lot to get through, and not a lot of time
And I feel like you weren't hearing me before
So here it goes, ahem

I know Hell's population is out of control
It's a bad situation, it's taking a toll
If we rehab these sinners and cleanse all their souls
At my Hazbin Hotel, wait, I'm getting ahead of myself!
Right, extermination
I know you guys fly down just to kill once a year
And it must be annoying to schlep all the way here
If they join you in Heaven, that trip disappears!
You can wave that chore farewell
It'll be a happy day in He—

[ADAM:]
Let me stop you right there

[CHARLIE:]
Oh

[ADAM:]
Save us all precious time

[CHARLIE:]
Okay

[ADAM:]
If what you're suggesting is letting them climb
Up the ladder oh, they'd rather cross the Pearly Gates?

[CHARLIE:]
Well, um

[ADAM:]
Sorry sweetie, but there's no defyin' their fates
'Cause Hell is forever, whether you like it or not
Had their chance to behave better, now they boil in a pot
'Cause the rules are black and white
There's no use in tryin' to fight it
They're burnin' for their lives until we kill 'em again

[CHARLIE:]
Okay, but

[ADAM:]
Just try to chillax babe, you're wasting your breath
Did I hear you imply that they don't deserve death?
Are they winners? Are they sinners?
'Cause it's cut and dry

[CHARLIE:]
Well actually, if you take a look—

[ADAM:]
Fair is fair, an eye for an eye

[ADAM (ANGELS):]
And, when all's said and done (Said and done)
There's the question of fun
And for those of us with divine ordainment
Extermination is entertainment!
Bow-now-now-nownow, guitar solo, fuck yeah!
Oh, da-ah-ah now-now-n-now-n-now-n-now-n-nownownow

[CHARLIE:]
Oh my god...

[ADAM & ANGELS:]
Hell is forever, whether you like it or not
Had their chance to behave better

[CHARLIE:]
Where did all of you people come from?

[ADAM & ANGELS:]
Now they boil in a pot
'Cause the rules are black and white
There's no use in tryin' to fight it
They're burnin' for their lives until we kill 'em again

[ADAM:]
Fuckin', Hell is forever and it's meant to suck a lot
So give up your dumb endeavor, 'cause you don't have a shot
Long as I got your attention
I guess I should probably mention
That we made the determination
To move up the next extermination

[CHARLIE:]
What?

[ADAM:]
Can't wait a whole year to slaughter those little cunts
I know it's just been a week, but we'll be back in six months!

[CHARLIE:]
Um, wait, didn't you—
Ugh, shit! 
?== Stayed Gone
[VOX:]
That fucker is back!

[VALENTINO:]
Yeah, I thought he was gone for good too

[VOX:]
It's been seven years!

[VALENTINO:]
You still pissed he almost beat you that time?

[VOX:]
Uh, fuck you

[VALENTINO:]
Just saying

[VOX:]
Things have changed a lot since he left town

[VALENTINO:]
That's for sure

[VOX:]
I gotta send a message of who's really in charge of things now
Welcome home
I'm gonna make you wish that you'd stayed gone
Say hello to a new status quo
Everyone knows that there's a brand new dawn
Turn the TV on!

[DIRECTOR:]
Camera speeds
Rolling in three, two

[VOX (STAFF) {VOX & STAFF}:]
(Welcome to the show)
Top of the hour, and we're discussing a certain has-been
Who has been spotted cavorting around town
(Welcome to the show)
After a seven-year absence
Did anybody miss him?
(Welcome to the show)
Did anybody notice?
More on tonight's program
So, the Radio Demon is back in town
Why is he hanging around?
What does that mean for your family?
Well handily, I've got good news
He's a loser, a fossil
And I don't mean to sound hostile, {but the demon is a coward!}
You can take that as gospel
Pulling my viewers? Impossible
I'm visual, he's barely audible
Stop giving him the time of day, don't listen to a word he'd say
I hope he had a nice vacay, {but he should've stayed away}

[VOX:]
While he hid in radio, we've pivoted to video
Now his medium is getting bloody rare
Hell's been better since he split
Where's he been? Who gives a shit?!

[ALASTOR:]
Salutations!
Good to be back on the air
Yes, I know it's been a while
Since someone with style treated Hell to a broadcast
Sinners, rejoice!

[VOX:]
What a dated voice!

[ALASTOR:]
Instead of a clout-chasing mediocre video podcast

[VOX:]
Come on!

[ALASTOR:]
Is Vox insecure, pursuing allure?
Flitting between this fad and that, is nothing working?

[VOX:]
Ignore his chirping!

[ALASTOR:]
Every day, he's got a new format!

[VOX & STAFF:]
You're looking at the future, he's the shit that comes before that!

[ALASTOR:]
Is Vox as strong as he purports?
Or is it based on his support?
He'd be powerless without the other Vees

[VOX:]
Oh, please!

[ALASTOR:]
And here's the sugar on the cream
He asked me to join his team!

[VOX:]
H-hold on!

[ALASTOR:]
I said no, and now he's pissy
That's the tea!

[VOX:]
You old-timey prick, I'll show you suf-ffering

[ALASTOR:]
Uh oh, the TV is buffering!

[VOX:]
I'll destroy you, yo-ou lit-tle—

[ALASTOR:]
I'm afraid you've lost your signal
Let's begin
I'm gonna make you wish that I'd stayed gone, tune on in
When I'm done, your status quo will know its race is run
Oh, this will be fun

[VOX:]
Fuck! 
?== It Starts With Sorry
[CHARLIE:]
It starts with "sorry"
That's your foot in the door, one simple "sorry"
Spoken straight from your core
The path to forgiveness is a twisting trail of hearts
But "sorry" is where it starts

[SIR PENTIOUS:]
Who could forgive a dirtbag like me?
I don't deserve your amnesty

[ANGEL DUST & VAGGIE:]
Can't we just kill him?
Shoot him and spill his blood?

[CHARLIE:]
That's an option you could choose

[ANGEL DUST & VAGGIE:]
Works for us

[CHARLIE:]
But who hasn't been in his shoes?
It starts with "sorry"

[SIR PENTIOUS:]
Sorry

[CHARLIE:]
Dig down deeper and say one sincere "sorry"

[SIR PENTIOUS:]
I'm so sorry

[CHARLIE:]
And your journey's underway
It'll take time to cover your vast multitude of sins

[SIR PENTIOUS:]
It'll take time to cover my vast multitude of sins

[CHARLIE & SIR PENTIOUS:]
But "sorry" is where it begins
It starts with "sorry" 
?== Respectless
[CARMILLA CARMINE:]
You better show some respect!
Check your behavior, no one speaks to Zestial that way!
Did you expect us to sit back
And take your insolent, brazen display?

[VELVETTE:]
Haha, you've got it twisted
I'm not the one who needs a new attitude
Maybe you missed it, but I'm that #Bitch
And I will do nothing less than what I please (Woo!)
I'm the backbone of the Vees
Mad that I acted respectless?
Well, it's 'cause no one could respect this

Sorry group attendin'
Since when are overlords too scared to fight?
You're long past trendin'
Sorry bae, but I ain't swipin' right
You lost your relevance

[ZESTIAL:]
We can't act without more intelligence

[VELVETTE:]
Ugh, no wonder I'm so respectless
I could eat you lot for breakfast

[CARMILLA CARMINE:]
You and the Vees are inane and uninformed
Smug wannabes, who don't heed when you've been warned

[VELVETTE:]
Oops! Did I strike a nerve?
'Cause when I brought out the angel's head
Couldn't help but observe
That your wrinkled face was turning red
And why are you avoidin' war?
That's what the guns you sell are for
Thanks to my being respectless
One thing I'm starting to suspect is
You know why this angel's headless
Do you have a disclosure?

[CARMILLA CARMINE:]
This meeting's over! 
?== Whatever It Takes
[ZESTIAL:]
What weighs on your soul, old friend?
I implore you to share the load
If it was thou who slew the angel
Why not let your strength be known?

[CARMILLA CARMINE:]
I always thought that I would keep blood off my face
But when that thing attacked, I had to act
To cross that line and keep them safe
But if anyone knew, then all of Hell would rise to war
And who's to say who'd survive the fray?
I might lose the ones that I was killing for
So I, I'll be your keeper
Do whatever it takes, I'll make the mistakes
I'll keep you safe and keep this secret

[VAGGIE:]
When I saw your face
You made me feel like a stranger in a brand new place
And it felt so good to be understood
But there's so much I wished that I could say
So I, I'll be your armor
Do whatever it takes, I'll make the mistakes
I'll spend my life being your partner

[CARMILLA CARMINE:]
And I don't know what we might face
But I know I can't replace you
So I'll do anything to save you

[VAGGIE:]
And I will try to make your dreams come true

[CARMILLA CARMINE & VAGGIE:]
Whatever we go through
I know I, I'll be your keeper
I'll be your armor
Whatever it takes, I'll make the mistakes
I'll make the mistakes
Whatever it takes 
?== Poison
[ANGEL DUST:]
I'm not above a love to cash in
Another lover underneath those flashin' lights
Another one of those ruthless nights
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I shoulda guessed that this would happen
I shoulda known it when I looked in your red-hot eyes
Spewin' all your red-hot lies
Yeah, yeah, yeah

What's the worst part of this hell?
I can only blame myself

'Cause I know you're poison, you're feedin' me poison
Addicted to this feelin', I can't help but swallow up your poison
I made my choice, and every night, I'm livin' like there's no tomorrow

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Any way you want me, baby, that's the way you got me
I'll be yours
My story's gonna end with me dead from your poison

I got so good at bein' untrue
I got so good at tellin' you what you wanna hear
I disassociate, disappear
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So far beyond difficult to resist another gulp

Yeah, I know it's poison, you're feedin' me poison
I'm chokin' from the taste and I can't help but swallow up your poison
I made my choice, and every night, I'm wasted like there's no tomorrow

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Any way you want me, baby, that's the way you got me
I'll be yours
My story's gonna end with me dead from your poison

Poison, I'm drownin' in poison
I'm fillin' up my glass, but it's always hollow
Full of poison, I'm sick of the poison
Wish I had somethin' to live for tomorrow 
?== Loser, Baby
[HUSK:]
So things look bad, and your back's against the wall
Your whole existence seems fuckin' hopeless
You're feelin' filthy as a dive bar bathroom stall
Can't face the world sober and dopeless
You've lost your way, you think your life is wrecked
Well, let me just say you're correct

[ANGEL DUST:]
Wait, what?

[HUSK:]
You're a loser, baby
A loser, goddamn baby
You're a fucked-up little whiny bitch

[ANGEL DUST:]
Hey!

[HUSK:]
You're a loser, just like me

[ANGEL DUST:]
Thanks, asshole

[HUSK:]
You're a screws-loose boozer
An only one-star reviews-er
You're a power-bottom at rock bottom
But you got company

[ANGEL DUST:]
This supposed to make me feel better?

[HUSK:]
There was a time I thought that no one could relate
To the gruesome ways in which I'm damaged
But lettin' walls down, it can sometimes set you straight!
We're all livin' in the same shit sandwich

[ANGEL DUST:]
I sold my soul to a psychopathic freak

[HUSK:]
Haha! And you think that makes you unique?
Get outta here, man!
We're both losers, baby
We're losers, it's okay to be a

[ANGEL DUST:]
Coked-up, dick-suckin' ho?

[HUSK:]
Baby, that's fine by me

[ANGEL DUST:]
I'm a loser, honey
A schmoozer and a dummy
But at least I know I'm not alone

[HUSK:]
You're a loser

[ANGEL DUST & HUSK:]
Just like me

[HUSK:]
I got an appetite for gamblin'

[ANGEL DUST:]
I got an appetite for samplin' every drug and sex toy I can find

[HUSK:]
Go ahead baby, sing that song, come on!

[ANGEL DUST:]
I got no holes left to deflower

[HUSK:]
I sold my soul to save my power
Now I'm on that demon's leash

[ANGEL DUST & HUSK:]
I'm trapped and it gets worse with every hour

[ANGEL DUST:]
You're a loser, baby

[HUSK:]
A loser, but just maybe if we

[ANGEL DUST & HUSK:]
Eat shit together, things will end up differently

[HUSK:]
It's time to lose your self-loathin'
Excuse yourself, let hope in, baby
Play your card, be who you are

[ANGEL DUST & HUSK:]
A loser, just like me 
?== Hell's Greatest Dad
[LUCIFER:]
Haha, looks like you could use some help
From the big boss of Hell himself
Check out daddy's glowing reviews on Yelp
(Five stars! Flawless! Greater than great!)
Oh, with the punch of a pentagram
I wap-bam-boom, alakazam
Usually, I charge a sacrificial lamb
But you get the family rate

[LUCIFER & CHARLIE:]
Thanks, dad!

[LUCIFER:]
Who needs a busboy, now that you've got the chef? (Woah-oh-oh)
Michelin-tasting menu, free à la carte
I'll rig the game for you because I'm the ref
Champagne fountains, caviar mountains, that's just to start!

[ALASTOR:]
Who has been here since day one?
Who's been faithful as a nun?
Who makes you chuckle with an old-timey pun?
Your executive producer

[CHARLIE:]
That's true!

[ALASTOR:]
I'm your guy, your day-to-day
Your chum, your steadfast hotelier
Remember when I fixed that clog today?

[NIFFTY:]
I was stuck, thank you, sir!

[CHARLIE:]
Oh, you!

[ALASTOR:]
I'm truly honored that we've built such a bond

[CHARLIE:]
Aww!

[ALASTOR:]
You're like the child that I wish that I had

[LUCIFER:]
Uh, what?

[ALASTOR:]
I care for you, just like a daughter I spawned

[LUCIFER:]
Hold on now!

[ALASTOR:]
It's a little funny, you could almost call me dad

They say, when you're looking for assistance
It's smart to pick the path of least resistance

[LUCIFER:]
Others say, that in your needy hour
There's no substitute for pure angelic power!
Who just happens to also be your blood!

[ALASTOR:]
Sadly, there are times a birth parent is a dud
They say the family you choose is better

[LUCIFER:]
What a bunch of losers

[ALASTOR:]
Can you butt out of my song?

[LUCIFER:]
Your song? I started this!

[ALASTOR:]
I'm singing it, I'll finish it!

[LUCIFER:]
Oh, you tacky piece of...

[MIMZY:]
It's me, yes, it's me
I know you were all waiting for me
I'm here, what a gas
Took a while, but I'm present at last
It's me, it's me
Mimzy!

[LUCIFER:]
Who? 
?== More Than Anything
[LUCIFER:]
Charlie! You don't understand, Heaven never listens!
They didn't listen to me, they won't listen to you

[CHARLIE:]
You don't know that!

[LUCIFER:]
I do!
You didn't know that when I tried this all before
My dreams were too hard to defend
And in the end, I won't lose it all again
Now you're the only thing worth fighting for
More than anything, more than anything
I'll shelter and adore you more than anything

[CHARLIE:]
Dad, I don't need you to protect me from this

[LUCIFER:]
I just don't want you to be crushed by them like...
Like I was

[CHARLIE:]
Dad...
When I was young, I didn't really know you at all
I always felt so small
But I heard your stories and I was enthralled
The tales about your lofty dreams, I listened breathlessly
Imagining it could be me
So in the end, it's the view I had of you
That showed me dreams can be worth fighting for
More than anything, more than anything
I need to save my people more than anything

[LUCIFER & CHARLIE:]
I've been dyin' to find out who you are
I've been waiting, wanting the same thing
Looks like the apple doesn't fall far
Took you a while
I've missed that smile
All that I'm hopin', now that my eyes are open
Is that we can start again, not be pulled apart again
'Cause in the end, you are part of who I am
I'll support your dream, whatever lies in store
And who could ask for more?
More than anything, more than anything
More than anything, more than anything
I'm grateful you're my daughter more than anything
I'm grateful you're my father more than anything
More than anything 
?== Welcome To Heaven
[SAINT PETER:]
Dearly beloved, it is my pleasure to say unto thee
Welcome to Heaven, oh-oh
Where the virtuous reside 24/7, oh-oh
People are happy that they died
'Cause here we got no worries, got no burglaries, no strife
It's the perfect afterlife
Welcome to Heaven, oh-oh
Check out our sick décor, the spirits leaven, oh!
Please keep your brimstone off the floor
We've got the best and brightest, the politest of the lot
And everyone is hot!

[EMILY:]
Gosh, I'm so pleased to show some outsiders around
After you see our realm, you'll never wanna go back down

[SERA:]
Of course, it is just temporary
I'm sorry you can't stay

[SAINT PETER & EMILY:]
'Cause every single day in Heaven is a happy day
Welcome to Heaven, yeah 
?== You Didn't Know
[EMILY:]
But she was right, Sera
She showed us a soul can improve
He saw the light, Sera
Checked all the boxes that you said would
Prove a person deserves a second chance
Now we turn our backs, no second glance?

[SERA:]
It's not as simple as you think
Not everything is spelled in ink

[CHARLIE:]
It's not fair, Sera

[VAGGIE:]
Careful, Charlie, keep a cool head

[CHARLIE:]
No! Don't you care, Sera?
That just because someone is dead, it doesn't
Mean they can't resolve to change their ways
Turn the page, escape infernal blaze

[SERA:]
I'm sure you wish it could be so
But there's a lot that you don't know

[LUTE:]
What are we even talkin' about?
Some crack-whore who fucked up already?
He blew his shot, like the cocks in his mouth
This discussion is senseless and petty

[LUTE & ADAM:]
There's no question to be posed
He's unholy, case closed
Did you forget that Hell is forever?

[ADAM:]
A man only lives once, we'll see you in one month
Gotta say, I can't wait to...

[SERA:]
Adam...

[ADAM:]
Come down and exterminate you

[EMILY:]
Wait!

[ADAM:]
Shit

[EMILY:]
What are you saying? Let me get this straight
You go down there and kill those poor souls?

[CHARLIE:]
You didn't know?

[ADAM:]
Whoops

[LUTE:]
Guess the cat's out of the bag

[ADAM:]
What's the big deal?

[EMILY:]
Sera, tell me that you didn't know

[SERA:]
I thought, since I'm older
It's my load to shoulder

[EMILY:]
No!

[SERA:]
You have to listen, it was such a hard decision
I wanted to save you, the anguish it takes to
Do what was required

[EMILY:]
To think that I admired you, well
I don't need your condescension
I'm not a child to protect
Was talk of virtue just pretension?
Was I too naïve to expect you
To heed the morals you're purveying?

[CHARLIE:]
That's what the fuck I've been saying!

[CHARLIE & EMILY (SERA):]
If Hell is forever, then Heaven must be a lie (Emily!)
If angels can do whatever, and remain in the sky
The rules are shades of gray when you don't do as you say
When you make the wretched suffer just to kill them again

[CHARLIE:]
I was told not to trust in angels

[ADAM:]
By her?

[LUTE:]
Ha! She should know

[VAGGIE:]
We should go

[CHARLIE:]
No! Don't you see? We've come so close
Look at them fighting, they're at each other's throats

[ADAM:]
Don't you act all high and mighty
Did you ever think your little girlfriend might be a liar?

[VAGGIE:]
Don't, Adam please!

[ADAM:]
What's the fuss?
Why hide the fact that you're an angel just like us?
?== Out For Love
[CARMILLA CARMINE:]
I see you're driven by your detestation
Your every step is stoked with animus
You need a different type of motivation
Or there's no way that you can handle this

I know you're thirstin' for vengeance, Vaggie
You're out for blood
But you'll only stand a chance if you're out for love

Out for love, love
Think of who you care about
Protect them and be out
For love, love
You're gonna fight without gloves
Long as you're out for love

Fuel yourself with the fear of losin'
That somebody who's your reason to live
Harness your heart and you can't help choosin'
To fight with all you can give

I know you're thirstin' for vengeance, Vaggie
You're out for blood
But you'll only stand a chance if you're out for love

Out for love, love
Think of who you care about
Protect them and be out
For love, love
You're gonna fight without gloves
And when that push comes to shove
Yeah, you just might rise above
Long as you're out for love 
?== Ready For This
[CHARLIE:]
Have you ever wanted something that was so clear in your mind
That you could taste it?

[SUSAN:]
You mean like human flesh?

[CHARLIE:]
Eugh, sort of
It's a feeling like a rumbling in your gut
That you could finally be faced with
A billion needy faces
I guess what I mean to say is
For the first time in my life
I might have to be ready for this
Ready to be the one who's leading from the front
Gotta come into my own
Gotta come into my throne
Gotta take charge and defend my only home
And although I kinda feel unsteady
Now I need to be ready for this

Have you ever felt like you're willing to die
To save the people of your city?

[SUSAN:]
By die, do you mean use my teeth to rip flesh apart?

[CHARLIE:]
That's a start!
'Cause right now we need a leader
And it seems to me that destiny has picked me
To be that, if you'll permit me
So who's with me!

Wouldn't it be super to see more of Hell?
Join up now if you like travel
Come on boys, hop in the saddle!
Lot of sights to see en route to my hotel
Not the mention the camaraderie
Yes siree, you'll form life-changing friendships
With the folks along the way

[ALASTOR:]
And feast on all the angels you can eat

[CHARLIE:]
Okay...

[CANNIBALS:]
Free food? I'm in! Oh, cool! Woah, food!
It's time now to act
They're on the attack
When they move to strike
We will fight, biting back
We'll follow your lead
We're eager to feed
We'll sharpen our teeth for the heavenly feast
From this moment on, you can count on us
To be resolute and ravenous
Our appetites are whet and we're set to seize the day
So I say, oh hey, come join the flesh buffet

[CHARLIE:]
Well, that's a little violent, can we tone it down?

[ROSIE:]
Oh, don't be put off by their snarling
That's enthusiasm, darling!

[CHARLIE:]
Uh, they just seem a little murdery right now

[ROSE:]
Don't worry honey, that's their thing
Keep singing

[CHARLIE & ROSIE:]
We're super duper grateful to have you folks aboard

[CANNIBALS:]
We can't wait to taste an angel's wings!

[CHARLIE:]
Oh lord...
For the first time in my life
Maybe I can be ready for this
I can be the marshal leading the parade
I can come into my own
And I think I've always known
My destiny could never be postponed
When Adam brings the battle here
I must appear like I'm ready for this

[ROSIE:]
They're dancing along
They're singing her song

[ALASTOR:]
Surprised?
Why, I knew she could do it all along

[ROSIE & ALASTOR:]
She's bound to pass the test as princess of Hell
Like her daddy, she is madly power-fell

[ALASTOR:]
She's filled with potential that I could guide

[ROSIE:]
I concur!

[ROSIE & ALASTOR:]
Stick with her, you'll be on the winning side

[CANNIBALS, ALASTOR & ROSIE:]
For the first time in our lives
We know that we are ready for this

[ROSIE:]
We'll show Heaven a fight they won't forget!

[CANNIBALS, ALASTOR & ROSIE:]
It is time to take a stand

[CHARLIE:]
It is time to lend a hand!

[CANNIBALS:]
Huzzah!

[CHARLIE:]
Against the angels and their deadly threat

[CANNIBALS, ALASTOR & ROSIE:]
We cannot take it anymore
The time has come to go to war
Prepare to fight, we're ready for this

[CHARLIE:]
I really hope that I'm ready for this
?== Finale
[CHARLIE:]
He did it for us, the ultimate sacrifice
He gave me his trust, and look how we paid the price
This bloodshed could have been avoided
If I convinced Heaven to work together
I took a hotel and I destroyed it
I know I could have done better
Better, instead of letting you down

[LUCIFER:]
Come on little lady, why the frown?
In the last ten-thousand years
You're the first one to change this town
You can do this, now I know it!
For your story has just begun
You can't quit now, hell, you owe it
There's still damage to be undone
You've changed my mind, you've touched their hearts
Found the good in souls gone bad
The stage is wrecked, the crowd is gone
But by God, Charlie!
The show, it must go on

[LUCIFER, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, HUSK, NIFFTY & CHERRI BOMB:]
We can do this, we can build it
Best hotel that you've ever seen
Twice the bedrooms, we can fill it

[LUCIFER:]
With more sinners than you can dream

[LUCIFER & VAGGIE:]
It starts with you

[LUCIFER, VAGGIE & ANGEL DUST:]
You know it's true

[LUCIFER, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, HUSK, NIFFTY & CHERRI BOMB:]
Fulfill your destiny!

[CHARLIE:]
So long as I've got all of you with me

[NIFFTY:]
To build a hotel, I think we need some brick and lumber

[LUCIFER:]
Good thing we're in Hell
Check out this little magic number

[ANGEL DUST:]
Start with foundation

[LUCIFER:]
A remedial creation for me

[LUCIFER, ANGEL DUST & NIFFTY:]
It's as easy as can be!

[CHARLIE:]
No time for cryin', we've got a lot of work to do and
We gotta try and make the best of what's in ruins

[VAGGIE:]
New coat of paint!

[HUSK:]
New lights across the marquee

[CHARLIE, VAGGIE & HUSK:]
With a little sorcery

[VOX:]
After the battle, masterless cattle

[VOX & VALENTINO:]
Overlords hanging by a thread
With a bit of bravado, maybe tomorrow
We'll be atop the heap

[VALENTINO:]
While the rest of Hell's pissing

[VOX:]
Alastor's missing

[VOX & VALENTINO:]
Fled with his tail between his legs
Nature abhors a power vacuum
That leaves room for you and me
The future of Hell belongs to the Vee's

[ALASTOR:]
This place reeks of death, there's a chill in the air
And I barely escaped being killed by a hair
"Great Alastor, altruist, died for his friends"
Sorry to disappoint, that is not where this ends
I'm hungry for freedom like never before
The constraints of my deal surely have a backdoor
Once I figure out how to unclip my wings
Guess who will be pulling all the strings?

[LUCIFER, ANGEL DUST, HUSK, NIFFTY & CHERRI BOMB, (CHARLIE):]
We can do this (We can do this)
We'll be better (We'll be better)
Though redemption may take a while (Though it may take a while)
Wayward sinners clear their ledger

[ALASTOR:]
And we're doing it with a smile!

[CHARLIE, VAGGIE, ANGEL DUST, NIFFTY & CHERRI BOMB:]
Yeah!

[LUCIFER:]
Oh, this guy...

[CHARLIE:]
We'll make a difference, wait and see

[CHARLIE & VAGGIE:]
We're gonna do this, you and me

[CHARLIE, VAGGIE, LUCIFER, ALASTOR, ANGEL DUST, HUSK, NIFFTY & CHERRI BOMB:]
And then tomorrow, it will be a fuckin' happy day in Hell!
