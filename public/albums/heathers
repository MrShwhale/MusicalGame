?== Beautiful
[VERONICA, spoken]
September 1st, 1989
Dear diary
I believe I'm a good person
You know, I think that there's good in everyone, but—
Here we are, first day of senior year!
And, uh, I look around at these kids that I've known all my life and I ask myself – what happened?

[STUDENTS]
Freak, slut, burnout, bug-eyes, poser, lard-ass

[VERONICA]
We were so tiny, happy and shiny
Playing tag and getting chased

[STUDENTS]
Freak, slut, loser, shortbus

[VERONICA]
Singing and clapping, laughing and napping
Baking cookies, eating paste

[STUDENTS]
Bull-dyke, stuck-up, hunchback

[VERONICA]
Then we got bigger, that was the trigger
Like the Huns invading Rome

[MALE STUDENT, spoken]
Huh

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ugh! Oh, sorry

[VERONICA]
Welcome to my school, this ain't no high school
This is the Thunderdome
Hold your breath and count the days, we're graduating soon

[STUDENTS]
White trash

[VERONICA]
College will be paradise, if I'm not dead by June
But I know, I know life can be beautiful
I pray, I pray for a better way
If we changed back then, we could change again
We can be beautiful

[A PREPPY STUD knocks a HIPSTER DORK to the floor]

[HIPSTER DORK, spoken]
Ow!
[VERONICA]
Just not today

[VERONICA, spoken]
Hey, are you okay?

[HIPSTER DORK, spoken]
Get away, nerd

[VERONICA, spoken]
Oh, okay

[STUDENTS]
Freak, slut, cripple, homo, homo, homo

[VERONICA]
Things will get better soon as my letter
Comes from Harvard, Duke, or Brown
Wake from this coma, take my diploma
Then I can blow this town
Dream of ivy-covered walls and smoky French cafés

[VERONICA jostles RAM SWEENEY]

[RAM, spoken]
Watch it
[VERONICA]
Fight the urge to strike a match and set this dump ablaze

[RAM upends VERONICA'S lunch tray]

[RAM, spoken]
Oops

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ram Sweeney
Third year as linebacker and eighth year of smacking lunch trays and being a huge dick

[RAM, spoken]
What did you say to me, skank?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Aah, nothing

[VERONICA, STUDENTS, VERONICA & STUDENTS]
But I know, I know (I know, I know)
Life can be beautiful
I pray, I pray (I pray, I pray)
For a better way
We were kind before (Ooh)
We can be kind once more (Ooh)
We can be beautiful (Ooh, beautiful)

[MARTHA approaches]

[VERONICA, spoken]
Agh! Hey, Martha

[MARTHA, spoken]
Hey

[MARTHA helps VERONICA pick up her tray]

[VERONICA, spoken]
Martha Dunnstock, my best friend since diapers

[MARTHA, spoken]
We on for movie night?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Yeah, you're on Jiffy Pop detail

[MARTHA, spoken]
I rented The Princess Bride

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ho-ho-ho, again?
Wait, don't you have it memorized by now?

[MARTHA, spoken]
What can I say? I'm a sucker for a happy ending

[KURT, spoken]
Martha Dumptruck
Wide load, honk!

[KURT KELLY knocks the tray from MARTHA'S hands]

[KURT, spoken]
Haha!

[VERONICA, spoken]
Kurt Kelly, quarterback
He is the smartest guy on the football team
Which is kind of like being the tallest dwarf

[KURT, spoken]
Haha, aright!

[VERONICA, spoken]
Hey! Pick that up, right now

[KURT, spoken]
I'm sorry, are you actually talking to me?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Yes, I am
I wanna know what gives you the right to pick on my friend
You're a high school has-been waiting to happen
A future gas station attendant

[KURT, spoken]
You have a zit right there

[KURT and STUDENTS laugh]

[VERONICA, spoken]
Dear diary

[VERONICA]
Why?

[HIPSTER DORK]
Why do they hate me?

[YOUNG REPUBLICANETTE]
Why don't I fight back?

[KURT]
Why do I act like such a creep?

[VERONICA]
Why?

[MARTHA]
Why won't he date me?

[RAM]
Why did I hit him?

[STONER CHICK, MS. FLEMING & PREPPY STUD]
Why do I cry myself to sleep?

[VERONICA]
Why?

[STUDENTS]
Somebody hug me
Somebody fix me
Somebody save me

[STUDENTS & VERONICA]
Send me a sign, God
Give me some hope here
Something to live for

[The three HEATHERS enter]

[STUDENTS]
Ah-ah, Heather, Heather and Heather

[VERONICA, spoken]
And then there's the Heathers, they float above it all

[STUDENTS]
I love Heather, Heather and Heather
I hate Heather, Heather and Heather

[VERONICA, spoken]
Heather McNamara, head cheerleader
Her dad is loaded — he sells engagement rings

[STUDENTS]
I want Heather, Heather and Heather

[VERONICA, spoken]
Heather Duke, runs the yearbook
No discernible personality, but her mom did pay for implants

[STUDENTS]
I need Heather, Heather—

[VERONICA, spoken]
And Heather Chandler, the Almighty
She is a mythic bitch

They're solid Teflon — never bothered, never harassed
I would give anything to be like that

[STUDENTS]
Mmm

[HIPSTER DORK, spoken]
I'd like to be their boyfriend

[STUDENTS]
That would be beautiful
Mmm

[STONER CHICK, spoken]
If I sat at their table, guys would notice me

[STUDENTS]
So beautiful
Ooh

[MARTHA, spoken]
I'd like them to be nicer

[STUDENTS]
That would be beautiful
Ooh

[BELEAGUERED GEEK, spoken]
I'd like to kidnap a Heather and photograph her naked in an abandoned warehouse and leave her tied up for the rats

[VERONICA enters the girls' bathroom. HEATHER CHANDLER and MCNAMARA are watching HEATHER DUKE vomit into a toilet]

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Grow up, Heather, bulimia's so '87

[HEATHER MCNAMARA, spoken]
Maybe you should see a doctor, Heather

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Yeah, Heather. Maybe I should

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Ah, Heather and Heather

[HEATHER DUKE vomits]

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
...and Heather
Perhaps you didn't hear the bell over all the vomiting
You're late for class

[VERONICA scribbles on a piece of paper]

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Heather wasn't feeling well, we're helping her

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Not without a hall pass, you're not
Week's detention

[VERONICA, spoken]
Um, actually, Ms. Fleming, all four of us are out on a hall pass
Yearbook committee

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
I see you're all listed
Hurry up and get where you're going

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
This is an excellent forgery. Who are you?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Uh, Veronica Sawyer. I crave a boon

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
What boon?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Um, let me sit at your table, at lunch
Just once, no talking necessary
If people think that you guys tolerate me, then they'll leave me alone

[The HEATHERS laugh]

[VERONICA, spoken]
Before you answer, I also do report cards, permission slips and absence notes

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
How about prescriptions?

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Shut up, Heather

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Sorry, Heather

[HEATHER CHANDLER inspects VERONICA'S face]

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
For a greasy little nobody, you do have good bone structure

[HEATHER MCNAMARA, spoken]
And a symmetrical face
If I took a meat cleaver down the center of your skull, I'd have matching halves
That's very important

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Of course, you could stand to lose a few pounds

[HEATHER CHANDLER]
And you know, you know, you know?
This could be beautiful
Mascara, maybe some lip gloss
And we're on our way
Get this girl some blush
And Heather, I need your brush
Let's make her beautiful

[HEATHER DUKE]
Let's make her beautiful

[HEATHER MCNAMARA]
Let's make her beautiful

[HEATHER CHANDLER]
Make her beautiful

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Okay?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Okay

[KURT]
Out of my way, geek

[BELEAGUERED GEEK]
I don't want trouble

[RAM]
You're gonna die at 3 pm

[REPUBLICANETTE & NEW WAVE GIRL]
Don't you dare touch me
Get away, pervert

[BELEAGUERED GEEK]
What did I ever do to them?

[STUDENTS]
Who could survive this?
I can't escape this
I think I'm dying

[MS. FLEMING]
Who's that with Heather?

[THE HEATHERS enter again]

[STUDENTS, spoken]
Woah

[STUDENTS]
Heather, Heather, Heather

[REPUBLICANETTE & NEW WAVE GIRL]
And someone

[STUDENTS]
Heather, Heather, Heather

[PRINCIPAL GOWAN & COACH RIPPER]
And a babe

[STUDENTS]
Heather, Heather, Heather

[MARTHA, spoken]
Veronica?

[STUDENTS]
Veronica, Veronica, Veronica

[THE HEATHERS part, revealing a smoking hot VERONICA who has been given a makeover]

[VERONICA, STUDENTS, VERONICA & STUDENTS]
And you know, you know, you know (Ohh-oh)
Life can be beautiful
You hope, you dream, you pray (Ohh-ah)
And you get your way (Beautiful)
Ask me how it feels
Lookin' like hell on wheels (Ooh-ah)
My God, it's beautiful (Beautiful)
I might be beautiful (Beautiful)
And when you're beautiful (Ahh)
It's a beautiful frickin' day

Heather, Heather, Heather, Veronica (Hey-yeah)
Heather, Heather, Heather
Veronica, Veronica, Veronica, Veronica, Veronica
?== Candy Store
[H. CHANDLER, spoken]
Are we gonna have a problem?
You got a bone to pick?
You've come so far, why now are you pulling on my dick?
I'd normally slap your face off
And everyone here could watch
But I'm feeling nice, here's some advice
Listen up, biatch

[HEATHERS]
I like

[H. CHANDLER, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
Lookin' hot, buying stuff they cannot
(I like) Drinkin' hard, maxin' Dad's credit card
(I like) Skippin' gym, scarin' her, screwin' him
(I like) Killer clothes

[HEATHERS]
Kickin' nerds in the nose

[H. CHANDLER, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
If you lack the balls, you can go play dolls
Let your mommy fix you a snack
Woah
Or you could come smoke, pound some rum and coke
In my Porsche with the quarterback
Woah, woah, woah

[HEATHERS]
Honey, whatchu waitin' for?
Welcome to my candy store
Time for you to prove you're not a loser anymore
Then step into my candy store

[HEATHERS, H. DUKE, H. MCNAMARA, H. CHANDLER]
(Guys fall) At your feet, pay the check, help you cheat
(All you) Have to do: Say goodbye to Shamu
(That freak's) Not your friend, I can tell in the end
(If she) Had your shot, she would leave you to rot

[H. MCNAMARA]
'Course if you don't care, fine! Go braid her hair
Maybe Sesame Street is on

[H. CHANDLER & H. DUKE]
Woah

[H. MCNAMARA]
Or forget that creep

[H. DUKE]
And get in my Jeep

[H. CHANDLER]
Let's go tear up someone's lawn
[H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
Woah, woah, woah

[HEATHERS]
Honey, whatchu waitin' for?
Welcome to my candy store
You just gotta prove you're not a pussy anymore
Then step into my candy store

[H. CHANDLER, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
You can join the team (Or you can bitch and moan)
You can live the dream (Or you can die alone)
You can fly with eagles

[HEATHERS]
Or if you prefer

[H. CHANDLER]
Keep on testing me

[HEATHERS]
And end up like her

[MARTHA, spoken]
Veronica, look! Ram invited me to his homecoming party
This proves he's been thinking about me
[VERONICA, spoken]
Color me stoked

[MARTHA, spoken]
I'm so happy

[H. DUKE, H. CHANDLER & H. MCNAMARA]
(Woah) Ooh-woah
Honey, whatchu waitin' fo—

[H. CHANDLER, spoken]
Shut up, Heather!

[H. CHANDLER, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
Step into my candy store
Woah, time for you to prove you're not a lame-ass anymore
Oh-ohh

[HEATHERS]
Then step into my candy store
It's my candy store, it's my candy
It's my candy store, it's my candy
It's my candy store, it's my candy store
?== Fight For Me
[GIRLS, BOYS, ALL]
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit

[VERONICA]
Why, when you see boys fight
Does it look so horrible, yet feel so right?
I shouldn't watch this crap, that's not who I am
But with this kid, damn

Hey, Mr. No-Name Kid, so who might you be?
And could you fight for me?
And hey, could you face the crowd?
Could you be seen with me and still act proud?
Hey, could you hold my hand?
And could you carry me through no man's land?
It's fine if you don't agree
But I would fight for you, if you would fight for me

[VERONICA, STUDENTS]
Let them drive us underground (Ah)
I don't care how far (Ah)
You can set my broken bones (Ah)
And I know CPR (Ah)

Well, woah, you can punch real good
You've lasted longer than I thought you would
So hey, Mr. No-Name Kid, if some night, you're free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Wanna fight for me? (Holy shit)
If you're still alive (Holy shit)
I would fight for you (Holy shit, holy shit)
If you would fight for me
(Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit)
?== Freeze Your Brain
[J.D.]
I've been through ten high schools, they start to get blurry
No point planting roots, 'cause you're gone in a hurry
My dad keeps two suitcases packed in the den
So it's only a matter of when

I don't learn the names, don't bother with faces
All I can trust is this concrete oasis
Seems every time I'm about to despair
There's a 7-Eleven right there

Each store is the same, from Las Vegas to Boston
Linoleum aisles that I love to get lost in
I pray at my altar of slush
Yeah, I live for that sweet frozen rush

[J.D. takes a hit of his slurpee]

Freeze your brain
Suck on that straw, get lost in the pain
Happiness comes when everything numbs
Who needs cocaine?
Freeze your brain
Freeze your brain

[J.D., spoken]
Care for a hit?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Does your mommy know you eat all that crap?

[J.D., spoken]
Not anymore

[J.D.]
When mom was alive, we lived halfway normal
Now it's just me and my dad, we're less formal
I learned to cook pasta, I learned to pay rent
Learned the world doesn't owe you a cent

You're planning your future, Veronica Sawyer
You'll go to some college and marry a lawyer
But the sky's gonna hurt when it falls
So you'd better start building some walls

Freeze your brain
Swim in the ice, get lost in the pain
Shut your eyes tight 'til you vanish from sight
Let nothing remain

Freeze your brain
Shatter your skull, fight pain with more pain
Forget who you are, unburden your load
Forget in six weeks, you'll be back on the road
When the voice in your head says you're better off dead
Don't open a vein
Just freeze your brain
Freeze your brain
Go on and freeze your brain

[J.D., spoken]
Try it
?== Big Fun
[The KIDS cheer]

[RAM]
Dad says, "Act our age"
You heard the man, it's time to rage

[KIDS]
Blast the bass, turn out the light
Ain't nobody home tonight

[RAM]
Drink, smoke, it's all cool
Let's get naked in my pool

[KIDS]
Punch the wall and start a fight
Ain't nobody home tonight

[KURT]
His folks got a waterbed
Come upstairs and rest your head

[RAM]
Let's rub each other's backs
While watchin' porn on Cinemax

[KIDS]
Ahh
The folks are gone
It's time for big fun (Big fun)
We're up 'til dawn
Havin' some big fun (Big fun)
When mom and dad forget
To lock the liquor cabinet
It's big fun (Big fun)
Big fun, woo!

[VERONICA, spoken]
Okay, okay, okay, so, it's salt, and then lime, and then shot

[HEATHER MCNAMARA, spoken]
No, it's salt, then shot—

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
You're doing it wrong

[VERONICA, spoken]
Wait, really?
'Cause I feel great

[PREPPY STUD, spoken]
Veronica, you are lookin' good tonight
[VERONICA, spoken]
Woah

[VERONICA]
A hot guy smiled at me
Without a trace of mockery

[KIDS]
Everyone's high as a kite
Ain't nobody home tonight

[VERONICA]
Stoned, zoned, I should quit
Hey, is that weed? I want a hit

[KIDS]
Fill that joint and roll it tight
Ain't nobody home tonight

[VERONICA]
Dreams are comin' true
When people laugh, but not at you
I'm not alone, I'm not afraid
I feel like Bono at LiveAid

[KIDS]
Ahh
The house is ours
It's time for big fun (Big fun)
Let's use their showers
That sounds like big fun (Big fun)
Crack open one more case
[VERONICA, spoken]
I think that's what they call third base

[KIDS]
Big fun (Big fun)
Big fun

[VERONICA, spoken]
That actually looks like—

[KIDS]
Big fun (Big fun)
Big fun, woo!

[KURT, spoken]
Alright, people, listen up
What is Westerberg gonna do to the Razorbacks at Sunday's game?

[RAM, spoken]
Gonna make 'em go whee, whee, whee, whee

[KIDS]
Big fun, big fun

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Way to show maturity

[KIDS]
Big fun, big fun

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Quit it jackass, get off of me

[KIDS]
Big fun, big fun

[VERONICA, spoken]
Yo, Ram, emergency
I just saw some freshmen sneaking over the pool fence

[RAM, spoken]
I hate freshmen
Where are you little pricks? I'm comin' for you

[VERONICA, spoken]
Hey, are you okay?

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
I didn't need your help

[VERONICA, spoken]
Aww
Thanks, Heather, but I don't really have to vomit right now

[VERONICA cackles]

[KIDS]
The party's hot, hot, hot
It's time for big fun (Big fun)

[KURT, spoken]
You need a jello shot

[KIDS]
We're havin' big fun (Big fun)

[HEATHER CHANDLER]
Martha Dumptruck in the flesh

[HEATHER DUKE]
Here comes the cootie squad
We should—

[HEATHER CHANDLER]
Shut up, Heather

[HEATHER DUKE]
Sorry, Heather

[HEATHER MCNAMARA]
Look who's with her – Oh my God

[HEATHERS]
Dang, dang, diggety-dang-a-dang
Dang-dang, diggety-dang-a-dang

[VERONICA, spoken]
I can't believe you actually came

[MARTHA, spoken]
It's exciting, right?
Oh, I wanna say hello to Ram
I brought sparkling cider

[HEATHER CHANDLER]
Showing up here took some guts
Time to rip 'em out

[HEATHER DUKE]
Well, who's this pig remind you of?
Especially the snout

[HEATHER CHANDLER]
Ha

[HEATHERS]
Dang, dang, diggety-dang-a-dang
Dang, dang, diggety-dang-a-dang

[RAM, spoken]
Where the hell are those freshmen?

[MARTHA, spoken]
Hi, Ram
I— I wasn't gonna come, but since you took the time to write that sweet note

[RAM, spoken]
What note?
Why do you gotta be so weird all the time?
People wouldn't hate you so much if you acted normal
Pff, there's no alcohol in here
Are you trying to poison me?

[KIDS]
Dang, dang, diggety-dang-a-dang
Dang, dang, diggety-dang-a-dang
Dang, dang, diggety-dang-a-dang
Diggety-dang-a-dang

The folks are gone
It's time for big fun (Big fun)
We're up 'til dawn
Havin' some big fun (Big fun)
So let the speakers blow
They'll buy another stereo
Our folks got no clue
'Bout all the shit their children do
Why are they surprised?
Whenever we're unsupervised
It's big fun (Big fun)
Big fun (Big fun)
Big fun, big fun
Woo!

[The KIDS laugh]
?== Dead Girl Walking
[VERONICA]
The demon queen of high school has decreed it:
She says, Monday, 8 a.m., I will be deleted
They'll hunt me down in study hall
Stuff and mount me on the wall
Thirty hours to live – how shall I spend them?

I don't have to stay and die like cattle
I could change my name and ride up to Seattle
But I don't own a motorbike
Wait – here's an option that I like:
Spend these thirty hours gettin' freaky, yeah

I need it hard, I'm a dead girl walkin'
I'm in your yard, I'm a dead girl walkin'
Before they punch my clock
I'm snappin' off your window lock
Got no time to knock, I'm a dead girl walkin'

[J.D., spoken]
Veronica
What are you doin' in my room?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Shh

[VERONICA]
Sorry, but I really had to wake you
See, I decided I must ride you 'til I break you
'Cause Heather says I gots to go
You're my last meal on death row
Shut your mouth and lose them tighty-whities

Come on!
Tonight I'm yours, I'm your dead girl walkin'
Get on all fours, kiss this dead girl walkin'
Let's go, you know the drill
I'm hot and pissed and on the pill
Bow down to the will of a dead girl walkin'

And you know, you know, you know
It's 'cause you're beautiful
You say you're numb inside, but I can't agree
So the world's unfair, keep it locked out there
In here it's beautiful
Let's make this beautiful

[J.D., spoken]
That works for me, whoop—

[Instrumental Break]
[VERONICA, J.D.]
Yeah
Full steam ahead, take this dead girl walkin'
How'd you find my address?
Let's break the bed, rock this dead girl walkin'
I think you tore my mattress

[VERONICA, J.D., VERONICA & J.D.]
No sleep tonight for you
Better chug that Mountain Dew (Okay, okay)
Get your ass in gear
Make this whole town disappear (Okay, okay)
Slap me, pull my hair
Touch me there and there and there
And no more talkin' (No-oh-oh-oh)

Love this dead girl walkin'
(Woah, woah, hey, hey, yeah, yeah)
Love this dead girl walkin'
(Woah, woah, hey, hey, wait, wait)
Love this dead girl, yeah, yeah, yeah, ow
Yeah
?== The Me Inside of Me
[J.D., spoken]
Think
Long and hard, conjure her up in your mind
What would she say?
Wha-what's her final statement to a cold, uncaring planet?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Dear world

[VERONICA]
Believe it or not, I knew about fear
I knew the way loneliness stung
I hid behind smiles and crazy hot clothes
I learned to kiss boys with my tongue

[J.D., spoken]
That's good

[VERONICA]
But, oh, the world, it held me down, uh
It weighed like a concrete prom queen crown

[HEATHER CHANDLER]
No one thinks a pretty girl has feelings
No one gets her insecurity
I am more than shoulder pads and makeup
No one sees the me inside of me

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Jesus, you're making me sound like Air Supply

[J.D., spoken]
Keep going, this has to be good enough to fool the cops

[OFFICER MCCORD, spoken]
Wo-ho-hoah
Is it murder?

[OFFICER MILNER, spoken]
No, look
Here's a suicide note

[VERONICA & H. CHANDLER]
They couldn't see past my rockstar mystique
They wouldn't dare look in my eyes

[VERONICA, H. CHANDLER & COPS]
But just underneath was a terrified girl
Who clings to her pillow and cries
My looks were just like prison bars

[VERONICA & COPS]
They've left me a myriad of scars
[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
"Myriad", nice

[VERONICA, H. CHANDLER & COPS, COPS]
No one thinks a pretty girl has substance
That's the curse of popularity (Popularity)

[PRINCIPAL GOWAN]
I am more than just a source of handjobs

[VERONICA, H. CHANDLER, COPS & GOWAN]
No one sees the me inside of me

[PRINCIPAL GOWAN, spoken]
Heather Chandler's not your everyday suicide

[COACH RIPPER, spoken]
You should cancel classes

[PRINCIPAL GOWAN, spoken]
No way, Coach
I send the kids home before lunch and the switchboard'll light up like a Christmas tree

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Our children are dying!
I suggest we get everyone into the cafeteria and just talk and feel, together
[PRINCIPAL GOWAN, spoken]
Thank you, Ms. Fleming
Call me when the shuttle lands

[The FACULTY laugh]

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
I'm telling you, we all misjudged Heather Chandler
This is the loveliest suicide note I've ever read

[MS. FLEMING & H. CHANDLER]
Box up my clothing for Goodwill
And give the poor my Nordic Track
Donate my car to crippled kids
Or to those ghetto moms on crack
Give them my hats and my CDs
My pumps, my flats, my three TVs

[H. CHANDLER & FACULTY]
No one thinks a pretty girl has feelings
But I weep for all I failed to be (I failed to be)
Maybe I can help the world by leaving
Maybe that's the me inside of me

[PRINCIPAL GOWAN, spoken]
Aw, hell
Long weekend for everybody

[Everyone cheers]

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Hey, not so fast, kids
They're refueling the buses, which gives us a solid half-hour of healing
Now, I have mimeographed copies of the suicide note, so you all can feel Heather's anguish

[HEATHER MCNAMARA]
I never knew about her pain

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Go on

[HIPSTER DORK]
Her life had hit a rocky patch

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Feel

[YOUNG REPUBLICANETTE]
Deep down, she wasn't cruel or vain

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Heal

[STUDENTS]
She didn't mean to be a snatch

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Veronica, you're very quiet
What's on your mind?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Uh, maybe Heather realized that in order to be happy, she had to give up her power
And that the only way to do that was death

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
My God

[MS. FLEMING]
Look what we've done, we're breaking through
Heather would be so proud of you

[STUDENTS]
And you, and you (And you, and you)
No one thinks a pretty girl can touch you

[NEW WAVE PARTY GIRL, spoken]
Heather touching me

[STUDENTS, NEW WAVE GIRL]
But she's made us better than we were (Ooh, yeah)
Heather's dead, but she will live inside me
And I'll be the me inside of her

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Holy crap, this is awesome!

[STUDENTS]
Heather cried, our sins fell on her shoulders

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Jesus Christ

[STUDENTS]
Heather died, so we could all be free

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
I'm bigger than John Lennon

[STUDENTS]
Heather's gone, but she will live forever

[MARTHA]
She's the dove that sings outside my window

[BELEAGUERED GEEK]
She's the twin from whom I'm separated

[STONER CHICK]
She's the horse I never got for Christmas

[STUDENTS]
Heather sees the me inside of me
Heather is the me inside of me
Inside of me
?== Blue
[RAM, spoken]
Hey, 'Ronica

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ew
You got a left hand, use it

[KURT, spoken]
Don't talk mean like that

[RAM, spoken]
You'll hurt their feelings

[RAM, KURT, RAM & KURT]
You make my balls so blue, you hurt them badly
You make my balls so blue, they're hangin' sadly
What did they do to you that you hate them so?
Don't run from me, they're all beat up like a tacklin' dummy

They long for your embrace, they're warm like mittens
They'll curl up on your face and purr like kittens
You make my balls so blue, just look at them glow
They're beggin' you, don't make my balls so blue

[RAM & KURT]
Mhh

[VERONICA, spoken]
Heather? Heather? Open the door

[H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
Oh no, oh no, no, no

[RAM & KURT]
Mhh

[VERONICA, spoken]
Open the door!

[H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
Oh no, oh no, no, no

[RAM, KURT, RAM & KURT, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
You make my balls so blue (Ooh, so blue)
So please say hello
Hold 'em, enfold 'em and never let go (Ooh, ah)

Once you were geeky and nerdy (Ooh, ooh)
But they knew you're dirty (Ooh, ooh)
You set them on fire (Ooh, ooh)
Whatever you require, they'll do (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ah)
So take 'em home to meet your parents
[KURT & RAM, H. DUKE & H.MCNAMARA]
They'll wear a suit and tie (Ooh)

[KURT, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
And a fancy collar

[RAM, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
They'll sing a lullaby (Ooh)

[KURT & RAM]
La-la-la-la-la

[ALL]
Please make these balls not blue

[RAM]
Just for a while

[KURT, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
(Ooh) Can't wait 'til later

[KURT & RAM, ALL]
My pants are rubbin' like a hot cheese grater

[VERONICA, spoken]
Look, booze, drink
[KURT, spoken]
Thank you so much

[RAM, KURT, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
They will protect you, defend you
Respect you, befriend you
Like Winnie-the-Pooh (Winnie-the-Pooh)
Baby, baby, baby, they're so blue

[RAM, KURT, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
(Ooh) My balls will work for you
They will obey ya
(Ooh) They really need rescue
Like Princess Leia

[KURT & RAM, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
(Ooh) Baby, you've gots to come through

[KURT]
Teach them to smile

[RAM, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
You've got no clue how much these two depend on you

[ALL]
Please help them through
My balls are in your court

[RAM & KURT, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA]
You make them balls so blue (Yeah)
You make my balls so blue (You make them balls so blue)

[RAM, spoken]
Ow

[KURT, spoken]
Ow!

[RAM & KURT, H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA, ALL]
You make my balls so blue
You shake them (Good God), you quake them (My balls)
You break, you make my balls so blue

[H. DUKE & H. MCNAMARA, RAM, KURT]
You take them, you bake them (Lookit, lookit, lookit, lookit)
Chrissake

[ALL]
You make my balls so blue
Please make their dreams come true
And make these balls not blue
?== Our Love is God
[J.D.]
They made you cry, but that will end tonight
You are the only thing that's right about this broken world
Go on and cry, but when the morning comes
We'll burn it down and then we'll build the world again
Our love is God

[VERONICA, spoken]
Are you okay?

[J.D., VERONICA]
I was alone, I was a frozen lake
But then you melted me awake, see, now I'm crying too
You're not alone (You're not alone)
And when the morning comes (When the morning comes)
We'll burn away that tear
And raise our city here (Raise our city here)

[J.D. & VERONICA]
Our love is God

[VERONICA calls KURT, he answers]

[KURT, spoken]
Yello?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Hi, Kurt, it's Veronica
How did you know that it was always a fantasy of mine to have two guys at once?

[KURT, spoken]
Uhh, eh
Lucky guess?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Well, if you want it to come true, then meet me at the cemetery
At dawn

[KURT, spoken]
Free pussy

[RAM, spoken]
And we don't even have to buy it a pizza

[KURT, spoken]
Punch it in

[RAM laughs]

[KURT, spoken]
What?
[KURT laughs]

[J.D.]
We can start and finish wars

[J.D. & VERONICA]
We're what killed the dinosaurs
We're the asteroid that's overdue
The dinosaurs choked on the dust
They died because God said they must
The new world needed room for me and you

[J.D., VERONICA]
I worship you, I'd trade my life for yours
They all will disappear
We'll plant our garden here (Plant our garden here)
Our love is God (Our love is God)
Our love is God (Our love is God)

[VERONICA, spoken]
Whoa, is that real?

[J.D., spoken]
Yeah, but we're filling it with "Ich lüge" bullets

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ich lüge – what?
[J.D., spoken]
My grandad scored them in World War II
They contain this powerful tranquilizer
The Nazis used them to fake their own suicides when the Russians invaded Berlin
We will use them to knock Kurt and Ram out just long enough to make it look like a suicide pact
Complete with a forged suicide note

[KURT & RAM, spoken]
Ram and I died because we had to hide our gay forbidden love from a misapproving world

[J.D.]
And when the morning comes, they'll both be laughing stocks

[J.D. & VERONICA]
So let's go hunt some jocks

[KURT, spoken]
Heh, uh— Hi, Veronica

[RAM, spoken]
So do we just like, whip it out or what?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Uh, take it slow, Ram
Strip for me

[RAM, spoken]
Okay

[KURT, spoken]
Okay, hehe
What about you?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Oh, hm-hm
Well, I was hoping that you could rip my clothes off me, sport

[KURT, spoken]
Yeah, we can do that

[RAM, spoken]
Mh-hm, mh-hm

[VERONICA, spoken]
Count of three

[VERONICA, KURT & RAM, spoken]
One, two

[J.D., spoken]
Three

[J.D. shoots RAM, VERONICA shoots at KURT but misses]

[KURT, spoken]
Holy crap!

[J.D., spoken]
Stay there, I'll get him
Kurt? Kurt!

[KURT, spoken]
You killed my best friend

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ram?

[KURT, spoken]
Why are you chasing me?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ram, you're just unconscious, right, Ram? Ram!

[KURT, spoken]
I was just kidding about the Bo Diddley thing

[J.D., spoken]
Get off the fence, get off the damn fence

[KURT, spoken]
I don't understand

[J.D.]
We can start and finish wars
We're what killed the dinosaurs
We're the asteroid that's overdue

[KURT, spoken]
Stop being a dick

[J.D.]
The dinosaurs will turn to dust

[KURT, spoken]
What does that mean?

[J.D.]
They'll die because we say they must

[J.D. shoots KURT]

[VERONICA, spoken]
What the fuck have you done?

[J.D., VERONICA, ENSEMBLE]
I worship you, I'd trade my life for yours
We'll make them disappear, we'll plant our garden here
Our love is God, our love is God
Our love is God (Ah), our love is God (Ah)
Our love is God (Our love is God) (Ah)
Our love is God (Our love is God) (Ah)
Our love is God
?== My Dead Gay Son
[RAM'S DAD, spoken]
You wait just a minute, Paul

[The CONGREGATION gasps]

[RAM'S DAD, spoken]
It is ignorant, hateful talk like yours that makes this world a place our boys could not live in

[RAM'S DAD]
They were not dirty
They were not wrong
They were two lonely verses
In the Lord's great song

[KURT'S DAD, spoken]
Our boys were pansies, Bill

[RAM'S DAD, spoken]
Yes!

[RAM'S DAD]
My boy's a homosexual
And that don't scare me none
I want the world to know
I love my dead gay son

[RAM'S DAD, spoken]
I've been thinkin', prayin', readin' some magazines
And it's time we opened our eyes

[RAM'S DAD, CONGREGATION, RAM'S DAD & CONGREGATION]
Well, the good Lord made the universe, the Lord created man
And I believe it's all a part of his gigantic plan
I know God has a reason for each mountain and each flower
And why he chose to let our boys get busy in the shower (Ooh-ah)

They were not dirty (No)
They were not fruits (Woah)
They were just two stray laces (Ooh)
In the Lord's big boots (Woah)
Well, I never cared for homos much, until I reared me one
But now I've learned to love, I love my dead gay son
He loves his son, he loves his son, his dead gay son

Now, I say my boy's in heaven and he's tannin' by the pool
The cherubim walk him and him, and Jesus says it's cool
They don't have crime or hatred, there's no bigotry or cursin'
Just friendly fellows dressed up like their favorite Village Person (Ooh-ah)

They were not dirty (No, no)
They just had flair (Woah)
They were two bright red ribbons (Ooh)
In the Lord's long hair (Woah)
Well, I used to see a homo and go reachin' for my gun
But now I've learned to love
And furthermore
These boys were brave as hell
These boys, they knew damn well
Those folks would judge 'em, they were desperate to be free
They took a rebel stance, stripped to their underpants
Paul, I can't believe that you still refuse to get a clue
After all that we've been through, I'm talkin' you and me

[The CONGREGATION gasps]

[RAM'S DAD, spoken]
In the summer of '83

[The CONGREGATION gasps again]

[KURT'S DAD, spoken]
That was one hell of a fishin' trip

[CONGREGATION]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
They were not dirty, no
And not perverse, no, no
They were just two stray rhinestones
On the Lord's big purse
[RAM & KURT'S DAD]
Our job is now continuing the work that they begun

[CONGREGATION]
'Cause now we love, love, love, we love your dead—

[RAM & KURT'S DAD, CONGREGATION]
They're up there disco dancing to the thump of angel wings
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
They grab a mate and roller skate while Judy Garland sings
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
They live a playful afterlife that's fancy-free and reckless
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[KURT'S DAD]
They swing upon the pearly gates

[ALL]
And wear a pearly necklace, woo

[RAM & KURT'S DAD, CONGREGATION, ALL]
They were not dirty (No)
They were good men (Woah)
And now they're happy bear cubs in the Lord's big den

Go forth and love each other now
Like our boys would have done
We'll teach the world to love (The world to love)
The world to love
I love my dead gay son (Not half bad, your dead gay son)
My son (Wish I had your dead gay son)
My son (Thank you, dad, for your)
Dead gay son

[RAM'S DAD]
Woah
?== Seventeen
[VERONICA]
Fine, we're damaged, really damaged
But that does not make us wise
We're not special, we're not different
We don't choose who lives or dies
Let's be normal, see bad movies
Sneak a beer and watch TV
We'll bake brownies or go bowling
Don't you want a life with me?

Can't we be seventeen?
That's all I want to do
If you could let me in
I could be good with you

[VERONICA, J.D.]
People hurt us or they vanish
And you're right, it really blows
But we let go, take a deep breath
Then go buy some summer clothes
We'll go camping, play some poker
And we'll eat some chili fries
Maybe prom night, maybe dancing
Don't stop looking in my eyes (Your eyes)

[VERONICA & J.D.]
Can't we be seventeen?
Is that so hard to do?
If you could let me in
I could be good with you
Let us be seventeen
If we've still got the right

[VERONICA, J.D., VERONICA & J.D.]
So what's it gonna be?
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Tonight

Yeah, we're damaged, badly damaged
But your love's too good to lose
Hold me tighter, even closer
I'll stay if I'm what you choose
Can't we be seventeen? (If I am what you choose)
If we've still got the right ('Cause you're the one I choose)
You're the one I choose
You're the one I choose
?== Shine A Light
[MS. FLEMING]
Deep inside of everyone, there's a hot ball of shame
Guilt, regret, anxiety, fears we dare not name
But if we show the ugly parts that we hide away
They turn out to be beautiful by the light of day

[MS. FLEMING, STUDENTS, MS. FLEMING & STUDENTS]
Why not shine, shine, shine a light
On your deepest fear?
Let in sunlight now
And your pain will disappear
Shine, shine, shine
And your scars and your flaws (Ooh)
Will look lovely because you shine
You shine a light

Shine, shine, shine a light
Shine, shine, shine a light (Ooh)

[STONER CHICK, STUDENTS]
Every day's a battlefield (Ooh)
When pride's on the line (Ooh)

[PREPPY STUD, STUDENTS]
I attack your weaknesses (Ooh)

[STONER CHICK, PREPPY STUD & MS. FLEMING, STUDENTS]
And pray you don't see mine (Ooh)

[BELEAGUERED GEEK, STUDENTS]
But if I share my ugly parts (Ooh)

[BELEAGUERED GEEK, NEW WAVE GIRL & MS. FLEMING, STUDENTS]
And you show me yours (Ooh)
Our love can knock our walls down (Ooh)
And unlock all our doors (Ah)

[MS. FLEMING, STUDENTS, MS. FLEMING & STUDENTS]
Come on, shine, shine, shine a light
On your deepest fear
Let in sunlight now
And your pain will disappear

[MS. FLEMING]
Who wants to share what's in their heart?
No volunteers? Fine, I'll start
My name's Pauline, I live alone
My husband left, my kids are grown
In the sixties, love was free
That did not work out well for me
The revolution came and went
Tried to change the world, barely made a dent
I have struggled with despair
I've joined a cult, chopped off my hair
I chant, I pray, but God's not there
So Steve, I'm ending our affair
[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
And I faked it, every single time
Hoo, that feels fan-freakin'-tastic
One, two, take me home, kids

[MS. FLEMING, STUDENTS, MS. FLEMING & STUDENTS]
Shine, shine, shine a light
On your deepest fear
Let in sunlight now
And your pain will disappear
Shine, shine, shine
And your scars and your flaws (Ooh)
Will look lovely because you shine
(Ahh) You shine, you shine a light

Shine, shine, shine a light
Shine, shine, shine a light
Shine, shine, shine a light
Shine, shine, shine a light (Yeah)
Shine, shine, shine a light
Shine, shine, shine a light
Shine, shine, shine a light
Shine a light, yeah!
?== Kindergarten Boyfriend
[MARTHA]
There was a boy I met in kindergarten
He was sweet, he said that I was smart
He was good at sports and people liked him
And at nap time once we shared a mat
I didn't sleep, I sat and watched him breathing
Watched him dream for nearly half an hour
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Then he woke up

He pulled a scab off one time playing kickball
Kissed me quick, then pressed it in my hand
I took that scab and put it in a locket
All year long I wore it near my heart
He didn't care if I was thin or pretty
And he was mine until we hit first grade
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Then he woke up

Last night I dreamed a horse with wings
Flew down into my homeroom
On its back, there he sat
And he held out his arms
So we sailed above the gym
Across the faculty parking lot
My kindergarten boyfriend and I
And a horse with wings

Now we're all grown up and we know better
Now we recognize the way things are
Certain boys are just for kindergarten
Certain girls are meant to be alone
But I believe that any dream worth having
Is a dream that should not have to end
So I'll build a dream that I can live in
And this time, I'm never waking up

And we'll soar above the trees
Over cars and croquet lawns
Past the church and the lake
And the Tri-County Mall
We will fly through the dawn
To a new kindergarten
Where nap time is centuries long

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
?== Yo Girl
[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Martha Dumptruck took a belly flop off the Old Mill Bridge last night holding a suicide note

[VERONICA, spoken]
Oh my God
Is she dead?

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Just some broken bones
Just another geek trying to imitate the popular people and failing miserably

[H. CHANDLER, RAM & KURT]
Yo, girl, keep it together
I knew you would come far
Now you're truly a Heather
Smell how gangsta you are

[VERONICA, spoken]
Martha, I'm so sorry

[H. CHANDLER, RAM & KURT]
Yo, girl, feel a bit punchy?
She's not looking so well
Still, you've earned that red scrunchie
Come join Heather in hell

[VERONICA'S DAD, spoken]
Where have you been?

[VERONICA'S MOM, spoken]
We've been worried sick!
Your friend J.D. stopped by
He told us everything

[VERONICA, spoken]
Everything?

[VERONICA'S DAD, spoken]
Your depression? Your thoughts of suicide?

[VERONICA'S MOM, spoken]
He even showed us your copy of Moby Dick

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
He's got your handwriting down cold

[VERONICA'S MOM, spoken]
Please, honey, talk to us

[VERONICA, spoken]
No, you wouldn't understand
[VERONICA'S MOM, spoken]
Try me!
I've experienced everything you're going through right now

[H. CHANDLER, RAM & KURT]
Guess who's right down the block

[VERONICA'S MOM, spoken]
Your problems seem like life and death

[H. CHANDLER, RAM & KURT]
Guess who's climbing the stairs

[VERONICA'S MOM, spoken]
I promise they're not

[H. CHANDLER, RAM & KURT]
Guess who's picking your lock

[VERONICA, spoken]
You don't know what my world looks like

[H. CHANDLER, RAM & KURT]
Time's up, go say your prayers

Veronica's running on, running on fumes now
Veronica's totally fried
Veronica's gotta be trippin' on shrooms now
Thinkin' that she can hide
Veronica's done for, there's no doubt now
Notify next of kin
Veronica's trying to keep him out now
Too late, he got in
[J.D., spoken]
Knock, knock
Sorry for coming in through the window
Dreadful etiquette, I know

[VERONICA, spoken]
Get out of my house
?== Meant To Be Yours
[J.D., spoken]
All is forgiven, baby!
Come on, get dressed, you're my date to the pep rally tonight

[J.D.]
You chucked me out like I was trash
For that, you should be dead
But, but, but
Then it hit me like a flash
What if high school went away instead?
Those assholes are the key
They're keeping you away from me
They made you blind, messed up your mind
But I can set you free

You left me and I fell apart
I punched the wall and cried
Bam, bam, bam
Then I found you changed my heart
And set loose all that truthful shit inside
And so I built a bomb
Tonight, our school is Vietnam
Let's guarantee they never see their senior prom

I was meant to be yours
We were meant to be one
Don't give up on me now
Finish what we've begun
I was meant to be yours

So when the high school gym goes "boom"
With everyone inside
Pkhw, pkhw, pkhw
In the rubble of their tomb
We'll plant this note explaining why they died

[J.D. & STUDENTS, spoken]
We, the students of Westerberg High, will die
Our burned bodies may finally get through to you
Your society churns out slaves and blanks, no thanks
Signed, the students of Westerberg High
Goodbye

[J.D.]
We'll watch the smoke pour out the doors
Bring marshmallows, we'll make s'mores
We can smile and cuddle while the fire roars

[J.D., STUDENTS]
I was meant to be yours (Ah, meant to be yours)
We were meant to be one (Ah, meant to be one)
I can't make it alone (Ah, make it alone)

[J.D. & STUDENTS]
Finish what we've begun
You were meant to be mine
I am all that you need
You carved open my heart
Can't just leave me to bleed
[J.D., J.D. & STUDENTS]
Veronica, open the, open the door, please
Veronica, open the door
Veronica, can we not fight anymore, please?
Can we not fight anymore?
Veronica, sure, you're scared, I've been there
I can set you free
Veronica, don't make me come in there
I'm gonna count to three

[J.D. & STUDENTS, spoken]
One, two, fuck it

[STUDENTS]
Ah-ah-ah

[J.D. opens the closet to reveal VERONICA has hung herself with a bedsheet]

[J.D., spoken]
Oh my God
No, Veronica

[J.D., STUDENTS]
Please don't leave me alone (Ooh)
You were all I could trust (Ooh)
I can't do this alone (Ooh)
[J.D. & STUDENTS]
Still I will if I must

[VERONICA'S MOM, spoken]
Veronica, I brought you a snack
Veronica?

[VERONICA'S MOM screams]
?== Dead Girl Walking (Reprise)
[VERONICA]
I wanted someone strong who could protect me
I let his anger fester and infect me
His solution is a lie, no one here deserves to die
Except for me and the monster I created
Yeah, yeah

[VERONICA, STUDENTS]
Heads up, J.D., I'm a dead girl walkin'
Hey yo, Westerberg
Can't hide from me, I'm a dead girl walkin'
Hey yo, Westerberg
And there's your final bell (Ah)
It's one more dance and then farewell (Ah)
Cheek to cheek in hell with a dead girl walkin'

[H. MCNAMARA, STUDENTS]
Woah-oh-oh
Come on, Westerberg
Woah-oh-oh
Here we go, here we go now

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Veronica!
Jason Dean told me you just committed suicide

[VERONICA, spoken]
Yeah? Well, he's wrong about a lot of things

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Oh, I threw together a lovely tribute
Especially considering the short notice

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ms. Fleming, what's under the gym?

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
The boiler room

[VERONICA, spoken]
That's it

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Veronica, what's going on?

[VERONICA, STUDENTS]
Got no time to talk, I'm a dead girl walkin'
(Hey yo, Westerberg)

[STUDENTS]
Hey yo, Westerberg, tell me, what's that sound?
Here comes Westerberg
Comin' to put you in the ground
Go, go, Westerberg, give a great big yell
Westerberg will knock you out
And send you straight to hell
[VERONICA, spoken]
Step away from the bomb

[J.D. laughs]

[J.D., spoken]
This little thing?
Hardly call this a bomb
This is just to trigger the packs of thermals upstairs in the gym
Those are bombs
People are gonna see the ashes of Westerberg High School and they're gonna think, "There's a school that self-destructed not because society doesn't care, but because that school was society"
The only place that Heathers and Marthas can get along is in Heaven

[VERONICA]
I wish your mom had been a little stronger
I wish she'd stayed around a little longer
I wish your dad were good
I wish grown-ups understood
I wish we'd met before they convinced you life is war
I wish you'd come with me

[J.D., spoken]
I wish I had more TNT

[VERONICA & J.D. erupt into a handfight over J.D.'s gun]
[STUDENTS]
Ahh
Hey yo, Westerberg, tell me, what's that sound?
Here comes Westerberg
Comin' to put you in the ground
Go, go, Westerberg, give a great big yell
Westerberg will knock you out
And send you straight to—

[A gunshot is fired]
?== I Am Damaged
[J.D.]
I am damaged, far too damaged
But you're not beyond repair
Stick around here, make things better
'Cause you beat me fair and square

Please stand back now
Little further
Don't know what this thing will do
Hope you'll miss me, wish you'd kiss me
Then you'd know I worship you

[J.D., VERONICA]
I'll trade my life for yours (Oh my God)
And once I disappear (Wait, hold on)
Clean up the mess down here (Not this way)

[J.D.]
Our love is God, our love is God
Our love is God, our love is God

[VERONICA]
Say hi to God

[The bomb explodes]

[STUDENTS & FACULTY come out to the football field to see what just happened]

[HEATHER MCNAMARA, spoken]
Where have you been?
People were saying you killed yourself

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
You look like hell

[VERONICA, spoken]
I just got back

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Hey! What are you doing?
?== Seventeen (Reprise)
[VERONICA]
Listen up folks, war is over
Brand new sheriff's come to town
We are done with acting evil
We will lay our weapons down
We're all damaged, we're all frightened
We're all freaks, but that's alright
We'll endure it, we'll survive it
Martha, are you free tonight?

[MARTHA, spoken]
What?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Um, my date for the pep rally kinda blew— me off
So, I was wondering, if you weren't doing anything tonight, maybe we could pop some Jiffy Pop?
Rent a video?
Something with a happy ending

[MARTHA, spoken]
Are there any happy endings?

[VERONICA]
I can't promise no more Heathers
High school may not ever end
Still, I miss you, I'd be honored
If you'd let me be your friend

[MARTHA]
My friend

[VERONICA & MARTHA, BOYS]
We can be seventeen
We can learn how to chill
If no one loves me now
Someday somebody will (Oh)
We can be seventeen (Oh, oh)
Still time to make things right (Oh, oh)
One day we'll change the world (Oh)

[GIRLS, BOYS, ALL]
But let's kick back tonight (And you now, ya know, ya know)
Let's go be seventeen (You can be beautiful)
Take off our clothes and dance (Ya know, ya know, ya know)
Act like we're all still kids
'Cause this could be our final chance (And you know, ya know, ya know)
Always be seventeen (You can be beautiful)
Celebrate you and I (Ya know, ya know, ya know)
Maybe we won't grow old
And maybe then we'll never die

We'll make it beautiful
We'll make it beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful (Ah)
Beautiful, beautiful (Ah)
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful
