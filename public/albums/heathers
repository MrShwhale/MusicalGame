Dear diary
I believe I'm a good person
You know, I think that there's good in everyone, but—
Here we are, first day of senior year!
And, uh, I look around at these kids that I've known all my life and I ask myself – what happened?

[STUDENTS]
Freak, slut, burnout, bug-eyes, poser, lard-ass

[VERONICA]
We were so tiny, happy and shiny
Playing tag and getting chased

[STUDENTS]
Freak, slut, loser, shortbus

[VERONICA]
Singing and clapping, laughing and napping
Baking cookies, eating paste

[STUDENTS]
Bull-dyke, stuck-up, hunchback

[VERONICA]
Then we got bigger, that was the trigger
Like the Huns invading Rome

Huh

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ugh! Oh, sorry

[VERONICA]
Welcome to my school, this ain't no high school
This is the Thunderdome
Hold your breath and count the days, we're graduating soon

[STUDENTS]
White trash

[VERONICA]
College will be paradise, if I'm not dead by June
But I know, I know life can be beautiful
I pray, I pray for a better way
If we changed back then, we could change again
We can be beautiful

[A PREPPY STUD knocks a HIPSTER DORK to the floor]

[HIPSTER DORK, spoken]
Ow!
[VERONICA]
Just not today

[VERONICA, spoken]
Hey, are you okay?

[HIPSTER DORK, spoken]
Get away, nerd

[VERONICA, spoken]
Oh, okay

[STUDENTS]
Freak, slut, cripple, homo, homo, homo

[VERONICA]
Things will get better soon as my letter
Comes from Harvard, Duke, or Brown
Wake from this coma, take my diploma
Then I can blow this town
Dream of ivy-covered walls and smoky French cafés

[VERONICA jostles RAM SWEENEY]

[RAM, spoken]
Watch it
[VERONICA]
Fight the urge to strike a match and set this dump ablaze

[RAM upends VERONICA'S lunch tray]

[RAM, spoken]
Oops

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ram Sweeney
Third year as linebacker and eighth year of smacking lunch trays and being a huge dick

[RAM, spoken]
What did you say to me, skank?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Aah, nothing

[VERONICA, STUDENTS, VERONICA & STUDENTS]
But I know, I know (I know, I know)
Life can be beautiful
I pray, I pray (I pray, I pray)
For a better way
We were kind before (Ooh)
We can be kind once more (Ooh)
We can be beautiful (Ooh, beautiful)

[MARTHA approaches]

[VERONICA, spoken]
Agh! Hey, Martha

[MARTHA, spoken]
Hey

[MARTHA helps VERONICA pick up her tray]

[VERONICA, spoken]
Martha Dunnstock, my best friend since diapers

[MARTHA, spoken]
We on for movie night?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Yeah, you're on Jiffy Pop detail

[MARTHA, spoken]
I rented The Princess Bride

[VERONICA, spoken]
Ho-ho-ho, again?
Wait, don't you have it memorized by now?

[MARTHA, spoken]
What can I say? I'm a sucker for a happy ending

[KURT, spoken]
Martha Dumptruck
Wide load, honk!

[KURT KELLY knocks the tray from MARTHA'S hands]

[KURT, spoken]
Haha!

[VERONICA, spoken]
Kurt Kelly, quarterback
He is the smartest guy on the football team
Which is kind of like being the tallest dwarf

[KURT, spoken]
Haha, aright!

[VERONICA, spoken]
Hey! Pick that up, right now

[KURT, spoken]
I'm sorry, are you actually talking to me?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Yes, I am
I wanna know what gives you the right to pick on my friend
You're a high school has-been waiting to happen
A future gas station attendant

[KURT, spoken]
You have a zit right there

[KURT and STUDENTS laugh]

[VERONICA, spoken]
Dear diary

[VERONICA]
Why?

[HIPSTER DORK]
Why do they hate me?

[YOUNG REPUBLICANETTE]
Why don't I fight back?

[KURT]
Why do I act like such a creep?

[VERONICA]
Why?

[MARTHA]
Why won't he date me?

[RAM]
Why did I hit him?

[STONER CHICK, MS. FLEMING & PREPPY STUD]
Why do I cry myself to sleep?

[VERONICA]
Why?

[STUDENTS]
Somebody hug me
Somebody fix me
Somebody save me

[STUDENTS & VERONICA]
Send me a sign, God
Give me some hope here
Something to live for

[The three HEATHERS enter]

[STUDENTS]
Ah-ah, Heather, Heather and Heather

[VERONICA, spoken]
And then there's the Heathers, they float above it all

[STUDENTS]
I love Heather, Heather and Heather
I hate Heather, Heather and Heather

[VERONICA, spoken]
Heather McNamara, head cheerleader
Her dad is loaded — he sells engagement rings

[STUDENTS]
I want Heather, Heather and Heather

[VERONICA, spoken]
Heather Duke, runs the yearbook
No discernible personality, but her mom did pay for implants

[STUDENTS]
I need Heather, Heather—

[VERONICA, spoken]
And Heather Chandler, the Almighty
She is a mythic bitch

They're solid Teflon — never bothered, never harassed
I would give anything to be like that

[STUDENTS]
Mmm

[HIPSTER DORK, spoken]
I'd like to be their boyfriend

[STUDENTS]
That would be beautiful
Mmm

[STONER CHICK, spoken]
If I sat at their table, guys would notice me

[STUDENTS]
So beautiful
Ooh

[MARTHA, spoken]
I'd like them to be nicer

[STUDENTS]
That would be beautiful
Ooh

[BELEAGUERED GEEK, spoken]
I'd like to kidnap a Heather and photograph her naked in an abandoned warehouse and leave her tied up for the rats

[VERONICA enters the girls' bathroom. HEATHER CHANDLER and MCNAMARA are watching HEATHER DUKE vomit into a toilet]

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Grow up, Heather, bulimia's so '87

[HEATHER MCNAMARA, spoken]
Maybe you should see a doctor, Heather

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Yeah, Heather. Maybe I should

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Ah, Heather and Heather

[HEATHER DUKE vomits]

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
...and Heather
Perhaps you didn't hear the bell over all the vomiting
You're late for class

[VERONICA scribbles on a piece of paper]

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Heather wasn't feeling well, we're helping her

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Not without a hall pass, you're not
Week's detention

[VERONICA, spoken]
Um, actually, Ms. Fleming, all four of us are out on a hall pass
Yearbook committee

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
I see you're all listed
Hurry up and get where you're going

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
This is an excellent forgery. Who are you?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Uh, Veronica Sawyer. I crave a boon

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
What boon?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Um, let me sit at your table, at lunch
Just once, no talking necessary
If people think that you guys tolerate me, then they'll leave me alone

[The HEATHERS laugh]

[VERONICA, spoken]
Before you answer, I also do report cards, permission slips and absence notes

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
How about prescriptions?

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Shut up, Heather

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Sorry, Heather

[HEATHER CHANDLER inspects VERONICA'S face]

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
For a greasy little nobody, you do have good bone structure

[HEATHER MCNAMARA, spoken]
And a symmetrical face
If I took a meat cleaver down the center of your skull, I'd have matching halves
That's very important

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Of course, you could stand to lose a few pounds

[HEATHER CHANDLER]
And you know, you know, you know?
This could be beautiful
Mascara, maybe some lip gloss
And we're on our way
Get this girl some blush
And Heather, I need your brush
Let's make her beautiful

[HEATHER DUKE]
Let's make her beautiful

[HEATHER MCNAMARA]
Let's make her beautiful

[HEATHER CHANDLER]
Make her beautiful

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Okay?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Okay

[KURT]
Out of my way, geek

[BELEAGUERED GEEK]
I don't want trouble

[RAM]
You're gonna die at 3 pm

[REPUBLICANETTE & NEW WAVE GIRL]
Don't you dare touch me
Get away, pervert

[BELEAGUERED GEEK]
What did I ever do to them?

[STUDENTS]
Who could survive this?
I can't escape this
I think I'm dying

[MS. FLEMING]
Who's that with Heather?

[THE HEATHERS enter again]

[STUDENTS, spoken]
Woah

[STUDENTS]

[THE HEATHERS part, revealing a smoking hot VERONICA who has been given a makeover]

[VERONICA, STUDENTS, VERONICA & STUDENTS]
And you know, you know, you know (Ohh-oh)
Life can be beautiful
You hope, you dream, you pray (Ohh-ah)
And you get your way (Beautiful)
Ask me how it feels
Lookin' like hell on wheels (Ooh-ah)
My God, it's beautiful (Beautiful)
I might be beautiful (Beautiful)

It's a beautiful frickin' day

You can live the dream (Or you can die alone)
You can fly with eagles

Or if you prefer

[H. CHANDLER]
Keep on testing me

[HEATHERS]
And end up like her

[MARTHA, spoken]
Veronica, look! Ram invited me to his homecoming party
This proves he's been thinking about me

Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit

[VERONICA]
Why, when you see boys fight
Does it look so horrible, yet feel so right?
I shouldn't watch this crap, that's not who I am
But with this kid, damn

Hey, Mr. No-Name Kid, so who might you be?
And could you fight for me?
And hey, could you face the crowd?
Could you be seen with me and still act proud?
Hey, could you hold my hand?
And could you carry me through no man's land?
It's fine if you don't agree
But I would fight for you, if you would fight for me

[VERONICA, STUDENTS]
Let them drive us underground (Ah)
I don't care how far (Ah)
You can set my broken bones (Ah)
And I know CPR (Ah)

Well, woah, you can punch real good
You've lasted longer than I thought you would
So hey, Mr. No-Name Kid, if some night, you're free

?== Freeze Your Brain
[J.D.]
I've been through ten high schools, they start to get blurry
No point planting roots, 'cause you're gone in a hurry
My dad keeps two suitcases packed in the den
So it's only a matter of when

I don't learn the names, don't bother with faces
All I can trust is this concrete oasis
Seems every time I'm about to despair
There's a 7-Eleven right there

Each store is the same, from Las Vegas to Boston
Linoleum aisles that I love to get lost in
I pray at my altar of slush
Yeah, I live for that sweet frozen rush

[J.D. takes a hit of his slurpee]

Freeze your brain
Suck on that straw, get lost in the pain
Happiness comes when everything numbs
Who needs cocaine?
Freeze your brain
Freeze your brain

[J.D.]
When mom was alive, we lived halfway normal
Now it's just me and my dad, we're less formal
I learned to cook pasta, I learned to pay rent
Learned the world doesn't owe you a cent

You're planning your future, Veronica Sawyer
You'll go to some college and marry a lawyer
But the sky's gonna hurt when it falls
So you'd better start building some walls

Freeze your brain
Swim in the ice, get lost in the pain
Shut your eyes tight 'til you vanish from sight
Let nothing remain

Freeze your brain
Shatter your skull, fight pain with more pain
Forget who you are, unburden your load
Forget in six weeks, you'll be back on the road
When the voice in your head says you're better off dead
Don't open a vein
Just freeze your brain
Freeze your brain
Go on and freeze your brain

[J.D., spoken]
Try it

[VERONICA]
The demon queen of high school has decreed it:
She says, Monday, 8 a.m., I will be deleted
They'll hunt me down in study hall
Stuff and mount me on the wall
Thirty hours to live – how shall I spend them?

I don't have to stay and die like cattle
I could change my name and ride up to Seattle
But I don't own a motorbike
Wait – here's an option that I like:
Spend these thirty hours gettin' freaky, yeah

I need it hard, I'm a dead girl walkin'
I'm in your yard, I'm a dead girl walkin'
Before they punch my clock
I'm snappin' off your window lock
Got no time to knock, I'm a dead girl walkin'

Long and hard, conjure her up in your mind
What would she say?
Wha-what's her final statement to a cold, uncaring planet?

Dear world

[VERONICA]
Believe it or not, I knew about fear
I knew the way loneliness stung
I hid behind smiles and crazy hot clothes
I learned to kiss boys with my tongue

[J.D., spoken]
That's good

[VERONICA]
But, oh, the world, it held me down, uh
It weighed like a concrete prom queen crown

And give the poor my Nordic Track
Donate my car to crippled kids
Or to those ghetto moms on crack
Give them my hats and my CDs
My pumps, my flats, my three TVs

[H. CHANDLER & FACULTY]
No one thinks a pretty girl has feelings
But I weep for all I failed to be (I failed to be)
Maybe I can help the world by leaving
Maybe that's the me inside of me

Aw, hell
Long weekend for everybody

[Everyone cheers]

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Hey, not so fast, kids
They're refueling the buses, which gives us a solid half-hour of healing
Now, I have mimeographed copies of the suicide note, so you all can feel Heather's anguish

[HEATHER MCNAMARA]
I never knew about her pain

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Go on

[HIPSTER DORK]
Her life had hit a rocky patch

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]

[YOUNG REPUBLICANETTE]
Deep down, she wasn't cruel or vain

[STUDENTS]
She didn't mean to be a snatch

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
Veronica, you're very quiet
What's on your mind?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Uh, maybe Heather realized that in order to be happy, she had to give up her power
And that the only way to do that was death

[MS. FLEMING, spoken]
My God

[MS. FLEMING]
Look what we've done, we're breaking through
Heather would be so proud of you

[STUDENTS]
And you, and you (And you, and you)
No one thinks a pretty girl can touch you

[NEW WAVE PARTY GIRL, spoken]
Heather touching me

[STUDENTS, NEW WAVE GIRL]
But she's made us better than we were (Ooh, yeah)
Heather's dead, but she will live inside me
And I'll be the me inside of her

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Holy crap, this is awesome!

[STUDENTS]
Heather cried, our sins fell on her shoulders

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
Jesus Christ

[STUDENTS]
Heather died, so we could all be free

[HEATHER CHANDLER, spoken]
I'm bigger than John Lennon

[STUDENTS]
Heather's gone, but she will live forever

[MARTHA]
She's the dove that sings outside my window

[BELEAGUERED GEEK]
She's the twin from whom I'm separated

You make my balls so blue, you hurt them badly
You make my balls so blue, they're hangin' sadly
What did they do to you that you hate them so?
Don't run from me, they're all beat up like a tacklin' dummy

They long for your embrace, they're warm like mittens
They'll curl up on your face and purr like kittens
You make my balls so blue, just look at them glow
They're beggin' you, don't make my balls so blue

Well, the good Lord made the universe, the Lord created man
And I believe it's all a part of his gigantic plan
I know God has a reason for each mountain and each flower
And why he chose to let our boys get busy in the shower (Ooh-ah)

They were not dirty (No)
They were not fruits (Woah)
They were just two stray laces (Ooh)
In the Lord's big boots (Woah)
Well, I never cared for homos much, until I reared me one
But now I've learned to love, I love my dead gay son
He loves his son, he loves his son, his dead gay son

Now, I say my boy's in heaven and he's tannin' by the pool
The cherubim walk him and him, and Jesus says it's cool
They don't have crime or hatred, there's no bigotry or cursin'
Just friendly fellows dressed up like their favorite Village Person (Ooh-ah)

They were not dirty (No, no)
They just had flair (Woah)
They were two bright red ribbons (Ooh)
In the Lord's long hair (Woah)
Well, I used to see a homo and go reachin' for my gun
But now I've learned to love
And furthermore
These boys were brave as hell
These boys, they knew damn well
Those folks would judge 'em, they were desperate to be free
They took a rebel stance, stripped to their underpants
Paul, I can't believe that you still refuse to get a clue
After all that we've been through, I'm talkin' you and me

No volunteers? Fine, I'll start
My name's Pauline, I live alone
My husband left, my kids are grown
In the sixties, love was free
That did not work out well for me
The revolution came and went
Tried to change the world, barely made a dent
I have struggled with despair
I've joined a cult, chopped off my hair
I chant, I pray, but God's not there
So Steve, I'm ending our affair

Hoo, that feels fan-freakin'-tastic
One, two, take me home, kids

?== Kindergarten Boyfriend
[MARTHA]
There was a boy I met in kindergarten
He was sweet, he said that I was smart
He was good at sports and people liked him
And at nap time once we shared a mat
I didn't sleep, I sat and watched him breathing
Watched him dream for nearly half an hour
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Then he woke up

He pulled a scab off one time playing kickball
Kissed me quick, then pressed it in my hand
I took that scab and put it in a locket
All year long I wore it near my heart
He didn't care if I was thin or pretty
And he was mine until we hit first grade
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Then he woke up

Last night I dreamed a horse with wings
Flew down into my homeroom
On its back, there he sat
And he held out his arms
So we sailed above the gym
Across the faculty parking lot
My kindergarten boyfriend and I
And a horse with wings

Got no time to talk, I'm a dead girl walkin'
(Hey yo, Westerberg)

[STUDENTS]
Hey yo, Westerberg, tell me, what's that sound?
Here comes Westerberg
Comin' to put you in the ground
Go, go, Westerberg, give a great big yell
Westerberg will knock you out
And send you straight to hell
[VERONICA, spoken]
Step away from the bomb

[J.D. laughs]

[J.D., spoken]
This little thing?
Hardly call this a bomb
This is just to trigger the packs of thermals upstairs in the gym
Those are bombs
People are gonna see the ashes of Westerberg High School and they're gonna think, "There's a school that self-destructed not because society doesn't care, but because that school was society"
The only place that Heathers and Marthas can get along is in Heaven

[VERONICA]
I wish your mom had been a little stronger
I wish she'd stayed around a little longer
I wish your dad were good
I wish grown-ups understood
I wish we'd met before they convinced you life is war
I wish you'd come with me

[J.D., spoken]
I wish I had more TNT

[VERONICA & J.D. erupt into a handfight over J.D.'s gun]
[STUDENTS]
Ahh
Hey yo, Westerberg, tell me, what's that sound?
Here comes Westerberg
Comin' to put you in the ground
Go, go, Westerberg, give a great big yell
Westerberg will knock you out
And send you straight to—

[A gunshot is fired]
?== I Am Damaged
[J.D.]
I am damaged, far too damaged
But you're not beyond repair
Stick around here, make things better
'Cause you beat me fair and square

Please stand back now
Little further
Don't know what this thing will do
Hope you'll miss me, wish you'd kiss me
Then you'd know I worship you

[J.D., VERONICA]
I'll trade my life for yours (Oh my God)
And once I disappear (Wait, hold on)
Clean up the mess down here (Not this way)

[J.D.]
Our love is God, our love is God
Our love is God, our love is God

[VERONICA]
Say hi to God

[The bomb explodes]

[HEATHER MCNAMARA, spoken]
Where have you been?
People were saying you killed yourself

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
You look like hell

[VERONICA, spoken]
I just got back

[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]
Hey! What are you doing?
?== Seventeen (Reprise)
[VERONICA]
Listen up folks, war is over
Brand new sheriff's come to town
We are done with acting evil
We will lay our weapons down
We're all damaged, we're all frightened
We're all freaks, but that's alright
We'll endure it, we'll survive it
Martha, are you free tonight?

[MARTHA, spoken]
What?

[VERONICA, spoken]
Um, my date for the pep rally kinda blew— me off
So, I was wondering, if you weren't doing anything tonight, maybe we could pop some Jiffy Pop?
Rent a video?
Something with a happy ending

[MARTHA, spoken]
Are there any happy endings?

[VERONICA]
I can't promise no more Heathers
High school may not ever end
Still, I miss you, I'd be honored
If you'd let me be your friend

[MARTHA]
My friend

[VERONICA & MARTHA, BOYS]
We can be seventeen
We can learn how to chill
If no one loves me now
Someday somebody will (Oh)
We can be seventeen (Oh, oh)
Still time to make things right (Oh, oh)
One day we'll change the world (Oh)

[GIRLS, BOYS, ALL]
But let's kick back tonight (And you now, ya know, ya know)
Let's go be seventeen (You can be beautiful)
Take off our clothes and dance (Ya know, ya know, ya know)
Act like we're all still kids
'Cause this could be our final chance (And you know, ya know, ya know)
Always be seventeen (You can be beautiful)
Celebrate you and I (Ya know, ya know, ya know)
Maybe we won't grow old
And maybe then we'll never die

We'll make it beautiful
We'll make it beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful (Ah)
Beautiful, beautiful (Ah)
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful
