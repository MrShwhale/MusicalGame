[Catherine Of Aragon:]
(No no no no no no no way)

Have my golden rule
Got to keep my cool
Yeah, baby

[Ensemble:]
You know she's got to keep her cool

[Catherine Of Aragon:]
And even though you've had your fun
Running around with some pretty young thing
And even though you've had one son
With someone who don't own a wedding ring
No matter what I heard
I didn't say a word, no, baby

[Ensemble:]
You know she never said a word

[Catherine Of Aragon:]
I put up with your sh...
Like every single day

When I gave birth to Mary? aw hi baby

Daughters are so easy to forget

Been humble, been loyal, I've tried
To swallow my pride all along
If you can just explain
A single thing I've done to cause you pain, I'll go

No?

You've got nothing to say
I'm not going away
There's no way

You must think that I'm crazy
You wanna replace me baby

?== Don't Lose Ur Head
[Anne Boleyn:]
Grew up in the French court
Oui oui bonjour
Life was a chore
So

[Ensemble:]
She set sail

[Anne Boleyn:]
1522 came straight to the UK
All the British dudes lame

[Ensemble:]
Epic fail!
Ooh

[Anne Boleyn:]
I wanna dance and sing

[Ensemble:]
Politics

[Anne Boleyn:]
Not my thing

[Ensemble:]
Ooh

[Anne Boleyn:]
But then I met the king
And soon my daddy said
"You should try and get ahead!"
He wanted me, obviously
Messaging me like every day
Couldn't be better then he sent me a letter
And who am I kidding
I was prêt à manger

[Ensemble:]
Ooh

[Anne Boleyn:]
Sent a reply

[Ensemble:]
Ooh

[Anne Boleyn:]
Just saying 'Hi'

[Ensemble:]
Ooh

[Anne Boleyn:]
'You're a nice guy
I'll think about it maybe
XO baby'

[Ensemble:]
Uh oh

[Anne Boleyn:]
Here we go

[Ensemble:]
You sent him kisses

[Anne Boleyn:]
I didn't know I would move in with his missus

[Ensemble:]
What?!

[Anne Boleyn:]
Get a life!

[Ensemble:]
You're living with his wife

[Anne Boleyn:]
Like, what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't lose your head
I didn't mean to hurt anyone
LOL Say 'Oh, well!'
Or go to hell!
I'm sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
Don't lose your head

Three in the bed
And the little one said
"If you wanna be wed
Make up your mind!"
Her or me, chum
Don't wanna be some
Girl in a threesome
Are you blind?

[Ensemble:]
Ooh

[Anne Boleyn:]
Don't be bitter

[Ensemble:]
Ooh

[Anne Boleyn:]
'Cause I'm fitter

[Ensemble:]
Ooh

[Anne Boleyn:]
Why hasn't it hit her?
He doesn't wanna bang you
Somebody hang you

[Ensemble:]
Uh oh

[Anne Boleyn:]
Here we go

[Ensemble:]
Your comment went viral

[Anne Boleyn:]
I didn't really mean it
But rumours spiral

[Ensemble:]
Wow Anne, way to make the country hate you!

[Anne Boleyn:]
Mate, what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't lose your head
I didn't mean to hurt anyone
LOL Say 'Oh, well!'
Or go to hell!
I'm sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
Don't lose your head

Tried to elope
But the Pope said 'Nope!'
Our only hope was Henry
He got a promotion
Caused a commotion
Set in motion the C of E

[Ensemble:]
The rules

[Anne Boleyn:]
Were so outdated
Us two wanted to get X-rated

[Ensemble:]
Soon
Excommunicated

[Anne Boleyn:]
Everybody chill
It's totes God's will

Henry's out every night on the town
Just sleeping around like "What the hell?"
If that's how it's gonna be
Maybe I'll flirt with a guy or three
Just to make him jel
Henry finds out and he goes mental
He screams and shouts like
So judgemental!
You damned witch
Mate, just shut up!
I wouldn't be such a b...
If you could get it up

[Ensemble:]
Uh oh

[Anne Boleyn:]
Here we go

[Ensemble:]
Is that what you said?

[Anne Boleyn:]
And now he's going 'round like
"Off with her head!"

[Ensemble:]
No!

[Anne Boleyn:]
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he means it

[Ensemble:]
Seems it

[Anne Boleyn:]
What was I meant to do?

[Ensemble:]
What was she meant to do?

[Anne Boleyn:]
Like, what was I meant to do?

[Ensemble:]
What was she meant to do?

[Anne Boleyn:]
No, but what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't lose your head
I didn't mean to hurt anyone
LOL Say 'Oh, well!'
Or go to hell!

[Ensemble:]
Just go to hell!

[Anne Boleyn:]
Sorry, not sorry about what I said

[Ensemble:]
Sorry, not sorry about what she said

[Anne Boleyn:]
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
Don't lose your head 
?== Heart of Stone
[Jane Seymour:]
You've got a good heart
But I know it changes
A restless tide, untameable
You came my way
And I knew a storm could come too
You'd lift me high, or let me fall

But I took your hand
Promised I'd withstand
Any blaze you blew my way
'Cause something inside
It solidified
And I knew I'd always stay

You can build me up
You can tear me down
You can try but I'm unbreakable
You can do your best
But I'll stand the test
You'll find that I'm unshakable
When the fire's burnt
When the wind has blown
When the water's dried
You'll still find stone
My heart of stone

You say we're perfect
A perfect family
You hold us close for the world to see
And when I say you're the only one I've ever loved
I mean those words truthfully

But I know, without my son
Your love could disappear
And though it isn't fair
But I don't care
'Cause my love will still be here

You can build me up
You can tear me down
You can try but I'm unbreakable
You can do your best
But I'll stand the test
You'll find that I'm unshakable
When the fire's burnt
When the wind has blown
When the water's dried
You'll still find stone
My heart of stone

Soon I'll have to go
I'll never see him grow
But I hope my son will know
He'll never be alone
'Cause like a river runs dry
And leaves its scars behind
I'll be by your side
'Cause my love is set in stone

Yeah

[All:]
You can build me up
You can tear me down
You can try but I'm unbreakable
You can do your best
But I'll stand the test
You'll find that I'm unshakable
The fire's burnt
The wind has blown
The water's dried

[Jane Seymour:]
You'll still find stone
My heart of stone

[All:]
You can build me up
You can tear me down
You can try but I'm unbreakable
You can do your best
But I'll stand the test
You'll find that I'm unshakable
The fire's burnt
The wind has blown
The water's dried

[Jane Seymour:]
You'll still find stone
My heart of stone
?== Haus of Holbein
Welcome to the house
To the Haus of Holbein
Ja, ooh ja, das ist gut
Ooh ja, ja
The Haus of Holbein

Hans Holbein goes around the world
Painting all of the beautiful girls
From Spain, to France
And Germany
The king chooses one
But which one will it be?

You bring the corsets
We'll bring the cinches
No one wants a waist over nine inches
So what the make up contains lead poison?
At least your complexion will bring all the boys in

Ignore the fear and you'll be fine
We'll turn this vier into a nine
So just say 'ja' and don't say 'nein'

'Cause now you're in the house
In the Haus of Holbein!
Ja, ooh ja, das ist gut
Ooh ja, ja
The Haus of Holbein

We must make sure the princesses look great
When their time comes for the Holbein portrait
We know what all the best inventions are
To hold everything up
Ja, it's wunderbar

For blonder hair, then you just add a
Magical ingredient from your bladder
Try these heels, so high it's naughty
But we cannot guarantee that you'll still walk at forty

Ignore the fear and you'll be fine
We'll turn this vier into a nine
So just say 'ja' and don't say 'nein'

'Cause now you're in the house
In the Haus of Holbein!

Ooh ja, das ist gut
Ooh ja, ja
The Haus of Holbein
?== Get Down
[Anne Of Cleves:]
Sittin' here all alone
On a throne
In a palace that I happen to own
Bring me some pheasant
Keep it on the bone

Fill my goblet up to the brim
Sippin' on mead and I spill it on my dress
With the gold lace trim
Not very prim and proper
Can't make me stop

I wanna go hunting, any takers?
I'm not fake 'cause I've got acres and acres
Paid for with my own riches
Where my hounds at? Release the bitches
(Woof)
Everyday
Head back for a round of croquet, yeah
'Cause I'm a player
And tomorrow, I'll hit replay

You, you said that I tricked ya
'Cause I, I didn't look like my profile picture
Too, too bad I don't agree
So I'm gonna hang it up for everyone to see
And you can't stop me 'cause

I'm the queen of the castle
Get down, you dirty rascal
Get down
Get down
Get down you dirty rascal
Get down
Get down
'Cause I'm the queen of the castle

When I get bored
I go to court
Pull up outside in my carriage
Don't got no marriage
So I have a little flirt with the footman
As he takes my fur
As you were

Making my way to the dance floor
Some boys make an advance
I ignore them
'Cause my jam comes on the lute
Lookin' cute
Das ist gut

All eyes on me
No criticism
I look more rad than Lutheranism

Dance so hard that I'm causin' a sensation
Okay ladies, let's get in reformation

You, you said that I tricked ya
'Cause I, I didn't look like my profile picture
Too, too bad I don't agree
So I'm gonna hang it up for everyone to see
And you can't stop me 'cause

I'm the queen of the castle
Get down, you dirty rascal
Get down
Get down (you dirty rascal)
Get down
Get down
'Cause I'm the queen of the castle

Now I ain't sayin' I'm a gold digger
But check my prenup, and go figure
Got gold chains
Symbolic of my faith to the higher power
In the fast lane
My horses can trot up to twelve miles an hour
Let me explain
I'm a Wienerschnitzel, not an English flower
No one tells me I need a rich man
Doin' my thing in my palace in Richmond

You, you said that I tricked ya (tricked ya)
'Cause I (I), I didn't look like my profile picture (no no)
Too, too bad I don't agree (too bad I don't agree)
So I'm gonna hang it up (hang it up, hang it up) for everyone to see
And you can't stop, you can't stop me 'cause

I'm the queen of the castle
Get down, you dirty rascal
Get down (yeah, c'mon, ha!)
Get down (get down with me)
Get down you dirty rascal
Get down (it's Anna of Cleves)
(Aha-ha-ha, get)
Get down (ow!)
'Cause I'm the queen of the castle 
?== All You Wanna Do
[Ensemble:]
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby

[Katherine Howard:]
I think we can all agree
I'm the ten amongst these threes

[Ensemble:]
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby

[Katherine Howard:]
And ever since I was a child
I'd make the boys go wild

[Ensemble:]
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby

[Katherine Howard:]
Take my first music teacher
Henry Manox
I was young, it's true
But even then I knew

The only thing you wanna do is...

Broad, dark, sexy Manox
Taught me all about dynamics
He was twenty three
And I was thirteen
Going on thirty

We spent hours strumming the lute
Striking the chords and blowing the flute
He plucked my strings all the way to G
Went from major to minor
C to D

Tell me what you need
What you want
You don't need to plead
'Cause I feel
The chemistry
Like I get you
And you get me and

Maybe this is it
He just cares so much
It feels legit
We have a connection
I think this guy is different

'Cause
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby's
Touch me, love me
Can't get enough, see

All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby's
Please me, squeeze me
Birds and the bees me

Run your fingers through my hair
Tell me I'm the fairest of the fair

Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is

But then there was another guy, Francis Dereham

Serious, stern and slow
Gets what he wants and he won't take no
Passion in all that he touches
The sexy secretary to the dowager duchess

Helped him in his office had a duty to fulfill
He even let me use his favourite quill
Spilled ink all over the parchment
My wrist was so tired
Still I came back the next day
As he required

You see, I'm all you need
All you want, you don't need to plead
'Cause I feel the chemistry
Like I get you and you get me and

I know, this is it
He just cares so much
This one's legit
We have a real connection
I'm sure this time is different

'Cause
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby's
Touch me, love me
Can't get enough, see

All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby's
Please me, squeeze me
Birds and the bees me

You can't wait a second more
To get my corset on the floor

Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is...

Yeah, that didn't work out
So I decided to have a break from boys
And you'll never guess who I met

Tall, large, Henry the Eighth
Supreme head of the Church of England

Globally revered
Although you wouldn't know it from the look of that beard

Made me a lady in waiting, hurled
Me and my family up in the world
Gave me duties in court and he swears it's true
That without me he doesn't know what he'd do

You see, I'm all you need
All you want, we both agree
This is the place for me
I'm finally where I'm meant to be

Then he starts saying all this stuff
He cares so much, he calls me 'love'
He says we have this connection
I guess it's not so different

'Cause
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby's
Touch me, love me
Can't get enough, see

All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby's
Seize me, squeeze me
Birds and the bees me

There's no time for when or how
'Cause you've just got to have me now

Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is...

So we got married. Woo

With Henry, it isn't easy
His temper's short and his mates are sleazy
Except for this one courtier
He's a really nice guy just
So sincere

The royal life isn't what I planned
But Thomas is there to lend a helping hand
So sweet, makes sure that I'm okay
And we hang out loads when the King's away

This guy, finally
Is what I want, the friend I need
Just mates, no chemistry
I get him and he gets me

And there's nothing more to it
He just cares so much, he's devoted
He says we have a connection

I thought this time was different
Why did I think he'd be different
But it's never, ever different

'Cause
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby's
Touch me, when will
Enough be enough, see?

All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby's
Squeeze me, don't care
If you don't please me

Bite my lip and pull my hair
As you tell me I'm the fairest of the fair

[Ensemble:]
Playtime's over
Playtime's over

[Katherine Howard & Ensemble:]
Playtime's over

[Ensemble:]
The only thing
The only thing

[Katherine Howard:]
The only thing you wanna do is... 
?== I Don't Need Your Love
[Catherine Parr:]
You know I love you, boy
In every single way
Though I love you, boy
I'll miss you every day
Oh I love you, boy
I wish that I could stay with you
And keep the life I made with you
And even though this feels so right
I'm holding back the tears tonight

It's true I'll never be over you
'Cause I have built a future in my mind with you
And now the hope is gone
There's nothing left for me to do

You know it isn't true
But I must say to you
That I don't need your love, no, no
I don't need your love, no, no
It'll never be better than it was, no, no
But I don't need your love, no, no

I've got no choice
With the King I stay alive
Never had a choice
Been a wife twice before, just to survive
I don't have a choice
If Henry says "It's you", then it's you
No matter how I feel
It's what I have to do
But if, somehow, I had that choice
No holding back, I'd raise my voice

I'd say "Henry, yeah it's true
I'll never belong to you
'Cause I am not your toy, to enjoy till there's something new
As if I'm gonna give up my boy, my work, my dreams
To care for you"

"Ha, darling, get a clue
There's nothing you can do
I don't need your love, no, no
No, I don't need you love, no, no
There's nothing left to discuss, no, no
But I don't need your love, no, no"

But I can't say that
Not to the king
So this is goodbye
All my love
Catherine

So I sent that letter to my love
Got married to the king
Became the one who survived
I've told you about my life
The final wife
But why should that story
Be the one I have to sing about
Just to win? I'm out
That's not my story
There's so much more

Remember that I was a writer
I wrote books and psalms and meditations
Fought for female education
So all my women could independently
Study scripture
I even got a woman to paint my picture
Why can't I tell that story?
'Cause in history
I'm fixed as one of six
And without him
I disappear
We all disappear

[Ensemble:]
So we had no choice
But now it's us alone
So we've got no choice
No, we've got no choice
We're taking back the microphone
I'm gonna raise my voice
They always said:
"We need your love"
But it's time for us to rise above

It's not what went down in history
But tonight I'm singing this for me

Henry, yeah, I'm through
Too many times it's been told
And I have had enough
Love stories to get old
And you might think it's tough
But I've got to let your love run cold
We're taking back control (we're taking back control)
You need to know

I don't need your love, no, no
No, I don't need your love, no, no
Can't let it get the better of us, no, no
I don't need your love, no, no
I don't need your love, no, no
No, I don't need your love, no, no
I don't need your love, no, no
I don't need your love

We don't need your love 
?== Six
[Catherine Of Aragon:]
He got down on one knee
But I said "No way!"
Packed my bags
And moved into a
Nu-nu-nunnery!
Joined the gospel choir
Our riffs were on fire
At the top of the charts
Is where I'm gonna stay

[Anne Boleyn:]
Henry sent me a poem
All about my green sleeves
I changed a couple words
Put it on a sick beat
The song blew their minds
Next minute I was signed
And now I'm writing lyrics
For Shakesy P

[Jane Seymour:]
Since my first son
Our family's grown
We made a band
And got quite well known
You could perhaps call us
The Tudor Von Trapps
I'm just kidding
We're called the
Royalling Stones

[All:]
We're one of a kind
No category
Too many years
Lost in history
We're free to take
Our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're SIX!

[Anne Of Cleves:]
What a shame
Yeah, my face
It cost me the crown
So I moved to the
Haus Of Holbein!
In my hometown
His mates were super arty
But I showed them how to party
Now on my tour of Prussia
Everybody "Gets down"

[Katherine Howard:]
Music man tried it on
And I was like "Bye!"
So I thought "Who needs him?
I can give it a try"
I learned everything
Now all I do is sing
And I'll do that until I die

[Catherine Parr:]
Heard all about these rockin' chicks
Loved every song
And each remix
So I went out and found them
And we laid down an album
Now "I don't need your love"
All I need is SIX!

[All:]
We're one of a kind
No category
Too many years
Lost in his story
We're free to take
Our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're SIX!
Woah, woah
We're SIX!
Woooah, we're SIX
Woah, woah
For five more minutes

It's the end of the show
Of the historemix
We switched up the flow
And we changed the prefix
Everybody knows
That we used to be six wives
But we want to say
Before we drop the curtain
Nothing is for sure
Nothing is for certain
All that we know is that
We used to be six wives

But now we're one of a kind
No category
Too many years
Lost in history
We're free to take
Our crowning glory
For five more minutes...
We're one of a kind
No category
Too many years
Lost in history
We're free to take
Our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're SIX!
Woah, woah
We're SIX!
Woooah, we're SIX
Woah, woah
For five, four, three
Two, one more minute

We're SIX!
