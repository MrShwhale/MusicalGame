?== The Girl Who Drove Away
[SAM]
It starts as nothing
Just a thought or a dream
Then one day, you're in the driver seat
The key is in the ignition
And no one gave you permission
It's only you in the car
And only you know how uncertain you are
How your heart is racing
Still, you reach for the moment
You'll finally say…
I'm the girl who drove away

Leave the fear and doubt behind
Choose the road less traveled
Not the memories too real
Not the guilt that left you paralyzed
Close your eyes, and everything's clearer
Your life's in the rearview mirror
If no one knows who you were
The line between the dream and you
Starts to blur
Standing at the crossroad:
There's the girl who was written in your DNA
Or the girl who drove away
If I could feel it
The way the day blows across the sky
And how the miles keep on flying by
The dawn is breaking
The sun's nearly waking the life inside me
If only I could turn the key
?== We’re Just in Your Head
[KELLY, spoken]
Where are you headed?

[SAM, spoken]
I don’t know. It’s not like I have a map or anything

[KELLY, spoken]
Well, maps are for braindeads

[SAM, spoken]
I was just daydreaming

[KELLY, spoken]
Technically, you still are

[SAM, spoken]
You’re not here. I’m sitting alone in a parked car

[KELLY, spoken]
My car

[SAM, spoken]
Yeah

[KELLY, spoken]
Talking to yourself
[SAM, spoken]
I need to go back inside

[KELLY, spoken]
Fine. Go

[SAM, spoken]
I’m supposed to leave for college today

[KELLY, spoken]
Go!

[SAM, spoken]
I am the valedictorian. The valedictorian goes to college

[KELLY, spoken]
Oh, I know

[SAM, spoken]
But what if?

[KELLY, spoken]
What if she doesn’t? Oh, twist

[ADAM, (BEVERLY) {KELLY}]
Hey Sam, I was wondering, would you be my date to the freshman fling?
(Slide the car into gear, ease your foot off the break, that’s it. That’s all it is.)
{Let’s go, let’s go.}
Hey Sam. (Hey Sam.) {Hey Sam}
[KELLY, spoken]
Yo, snap out of it

[SAM, spoken]
Sorry, I think of one memory and they all come flooding back in a big jumble

[KELLY, spoken]
Uh, not a memory jumble!

[SAM, spoken]
This is your fault! All of this. I was figuring out who I was. The whole year, saying what I wanted, doing it, and then one day the phone rings...

[KELLY, spoken]
What? You think it's gonna bite?

[SAM, spoken]
Kelly and I, we were...

[KELLY, spoken]
Okay, give me the keys

[SAM, spoken]
What?

[KELLY, spoken]
Get in the car loser
[SAM, spoken]
What are you doing?

[KELLY, spoken]
Think about the one time I got you to skip school, fall of senior year

[SAM, spoken]
No

[KELLY, spoken]
You said “no” then, too. I said, “Get in loser, you’re wasting your best life!”

[SAM, spoken]
I won’t

[KELLY, spoken]
I said, “Samantha Brown, get in the car!”
?== Freedom
[KELLY]
Let's go
The highway's calling
The sun is shining
Let's get in the car and just remember...
Let's go

[KELLY, spoken]
Get in, loser

[SAM]
Kelly drove on all of our road trips
She believed in listening to the highway
You start driving
And keep driving
There's no stopping 'till Kelly says you've arrived

[KELLY, spoken]
You're not doing it right

[SAM, spoken]
Doing what?

[KELLY, spoken]
You're not in it
[SAM, spoken]
What are you talking about?

[KELLY, spoken]
You're not in the moment, Sam. Talk about what it felt like

[SAM, spoken]
What did it feel like?

[KELLY]
You remember
Feeling the wind blowing your hair...
You're not even trying

[SAM, spoken]
I am

[KELLY, spoken]
Try harder

[KELLY]
Picking a road and going anywhere
Remember the biker bar?

[SAM, spoken]
Oh, God!
[KELLY]
We're headed South...
And the biker!
Or maybe West
We don't know much
We're making up the rest
Tear up the atlas
Don't read the road signs
Driving for the sake of driving anywhere
That's freedom

[SAM]
Freedom

[KELLY, spoken]
What bug do you have up your ass?

[SAM, spoken]
I don't have a bug up my ass!

[KELLY, spoken]
Samantha Brown, do you see that fork up ahead?

[SAM, spoken]
Yeah
[KELLY, spoken]
Well, one way leads to our school and the other leads somewhere else. Which way do you wanna turn, left or right?

[SAM, spoken]
I don't know. You never take the same route twice, I have no idea where we are

[KELLY, spoken]
Who cares? If you don't choose, we're gonna hit that house! Left or right?

[SAM, spoken]
Hold on, let me pull up a map

[KELLY, spoken]
No, maps are for brain-deads, left or right?!

[SAM, spoken]
Aah, left!

[KELLY, spoken]
Very slow, Brown

[SAM, spoken]
So where are we going?

[KELLY]
I have no idea
Counting the miles as we go past

[SAM]
The tank is full, the sun is high

[KELLY]
Knowing that every mile could be our last

[SAM]
Just watching the day go by

[KELLY & SAM]
We won't look back
We never will

[KELLY]
We've come too far

[SAM]
We'll drive 'till we hit Nashville

[KELLY]
Nashville

[KELLY & SAM]
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

[KELLY, spoken]
Okay, where do you wanna go now?

[SAM, spoken]
Make a right!

[KELLY, spoken]
No... in life, Sam. Think big. What do you want?

[SAM, spoken]
Uh... I don't know, I wanna get my license?

[KELLY, spoken]
Bigger

[SAM, spoken]
I want the deafening sound of driving fast with the windows down

[KELLY, spoken]
More!

[SAM, spoken]
I want to break rules and do something unexpected!

[KELLY, spoken]
Good! I want Arby's

[SAM, spoken]
I wanna reach the horizon of impossibility

[KELLY, spoken]
I wanna go skinny dipping in the ocean

[SAM]
I wanna drive forever!
And I'm almost starting to feel it
How a day gives way to something deeper

[SAM (KELLY)]
(Freedom)
The cheap rest-stop
The town bypassed (Freedom)
The last-minute 'get in the car and let's go' (Go)

[KELLY]
Let's go! Let's go!
Pick a road, pick a highway
Any road is going my way
Let's go
Live it up with no complicated philosophies
No college, no career
No kids, no fancy house, no
Let's go!
Any road but the road we're on!

[KELLY & SAM]
No college, no career
No screaming kids, no mortgage
Driving anywhere

[KELLY]
Just driving straight into the dawn
That's freedom

[SAM]
There's something buried within here
A lesson to keep
The impulse
The life force
The diving in deep
I feel it, the chaos I usually flee
If I hold on right
Here could I learn to just... be

Don't talk about it. Live it. Don't feel the loss of it, feel it
Kelly driving, me riding shotgun
Windows open so loud I can't hear...
Just a couple girls out on the highway
Trees blurring into nothing and I am nothing and she is nothing
With no roadmap
And no curfew
Just two girls with nowhere we have to be

[SAM (KELLY)]
(Freedom)
Now she's laughing
And I start laughing (Freedom)
It's so real and so like a memory (Freedom)
And the sun is so bright that I'm squinting
And it feels like I've found
Freedom

[KELLY & SAM]
Freedom

[KELLY]
Yeah

[SAM]
Driving fast, the radio blaring

[KELLY]
Yeah

[SAM]
Windows open, singing like we're rock stars

[KELLY]
Oh yeah

[KELLY & SAM]
Yeah (x6)

?== Ordinary Senior Year
[SAM]
Something changed
The whole world collapsed
I was on a certain path
I knew what to do
I don’t know at all now
The leaves start to turn, it’s fall now
Am I that girl anymore?
That ordinary girl that I was before

[KELLY]
You don’t have to know that right now
Start again
Tell the story of how you got here
From an ordinary senior year
?== My Mom is a Statistician
[SAM]
My mom is a statistician
And she sees statistics everywhere

[BEVERLY]
Two to one, you'll hit a red light
Fifty to one, you hit a bear

[SAM]
She sees the world as a high risk game
Gambling with a fancy name
Trying to cheat death and stay alive
This is the way she taught me how to drive
Observe

[BEVERLY, spoken]
Say a car is traveling down the road at a constant velocity of 57 miles per hour and a pedestrian is crossing the road at 2.5 miles per hour, if the driver sees the pedestrian from a distance of a 132 feet and brakes, decelerating at a rate of 11.1 miles per hour per second, will the car hit the pedestrian, if so, when?

[SAM, spoken]
The answer obviously is yes. In two seconds. Physics is easy. Just plug the right numbers into the equation. Driving is real

[BEVERLY, spoken]
Are you ready to drive?

[SAM, spoken]
Are you ready for me to drive?
[BEVERLY]
Sure, I've had a good life
Slow down, Sam
You're growing up too fast
When it's time to go
I will let you know
I'll tell you when, Sam
Until then, Sam, let's just take things slow
SLOW DOWN, SAM, JESUS!
Do you know how many people die in car wrecks every year?

[SAM]
Yes, I do

[BEVERLY]
You don't

[SAM]
I do!

[SAM & BEVERLY]
41,000 people every year

[SAM]
I know
[BEVERLY]
That's a hundred people a day

[SAM]
Mom!

[BEVERLY]
Sam, you'll be a dead man

[SAM]
Woman

[BEVERLY]
Children under twenty shouldn't be allowed to drive
You can't trust your frontal cortex if you wanna stay alive
You grip on tighter when you steer
And overcompensate with fear
Or you will die tomorrow in the middle of the night
You crash and skid into a ditch
And no one will be able to find your mangled, dead, corpse

[SAM, spoken]
Yep, that's the mother I know and love

[BEVERLY]
Ooh
?== Sam Failed Her Driver’s Test
[SAM]
The first time you fail to get your license, adorable
The second time, surprising
But I was ambitious

[KELLY, ADAM, BEV]
Oh, Sam failed her driver’s test
Four times

[SAM]
The first time barely counts, I forgot my glasses

[ADAM]
Medical condition

[KELLY, ADAM, BEV]
That’s one!

[SAM]
Next, a parked car bumped into me

[BEVERLY]
Divine intervention?

[KELLY, ADAM, BEV]
That’s two!
[SAM]
The third time

[KELLY, ADAM, BEV]
Hoo-ooh

[SAM]
I left the parking brake on, which caused burning smell, which caused me to panic, which caused me to...

[KELLY, ADAM, BEV]
Pee
And flee
That’s three

[KELLY (as CAROL ANN)]
Samantha Brown?

[KELLY, ADAM, BEV]
Yeah, she failed one more
Driver’s test number four

[SAM]
Kelly? What are you doing?

[KELLY]
Don’t talk about it, Sam, live it!
Watch for traffic
The car’s not gonna drive itself
Both hands on the wheel
What? You think it’s gonna bite?
Well?
[SAM]
No...

[KELLY]
Okay. You be Sam

[SAM]
Who are you?

[KELLY]
The DMV lady Carol Ann. She’s from Minnesota

[SAM]
No, she's not

[KELLY (as CAROL ANN)]
She is now, dontch’ya know?
Turn the key. what does it feel like?

[SAM (KELLY (AS CAROL ANN))]
My hands are steady (Turn left onto Main)
I barely even have to steer (You should probably try staying in one lane)
And I feel ready (This part should be easy)
The road in front of me is clear (You’re making me feel queasy, dear)
And all at once I feel alive
[KELLY (AS CAROL ANN)]
Are you ready for the highway?

[SAM]
Yes!

[KELLY (AS CAROL ANN)]
OK, then

[SAM, KELLY, ADAM, BEV (ADAM)]
Drive!
Drive!
Drive! (Oh)
Drive!
?== Top Ten
[KELLY]
Now, let’s have the ceremony!

[SAM]
What ceremony?

[KELLY]
Uh, the one where you honor me

[SAM]
You want a ceremony?

[KELLY]
I want a monument, but I’ll settle for a ceremony. Honor me!

[SAM]
With what?

[KELLY]
The top ten ways for Kelly Manning to die

[SAM]
You’re misappropriating it

[KELLY]
You cannot stop this
Number 10: I go skydiving without a parachute
Number 9:
[SAM]
Old age

[KELLY]
Lame, impossible
Number 8: abducted by aliens with enormous genitalia
Seven:

[SAM]
Kelly eats Mentos with diet coke and explodes

[KELLY]
Now, that's a damn fine way for Kelly Manning to die
Six:

[SAM]
She tours the tundra and is swallowed by a yeti
Five:

[KELLY]
I eat some toenail polish at my mani-pedi
Four:

[SAM]
Hit by a meteor
Three:
[KELLY]
Caught in a gang war
Two:

[SAM]
Kelly likes caffeine and loves a random fling, so one time at a Starbucks she makes out with Sting. And Sting is all like "Kelly, I think you should come on tour." And Kelly’s all like...

[KELLY]
"I don’t know, is that Armani? Sure. Hahaha." But then Sting gets really clingy and when I say I have to go back to the States, he’s like...

[SAM, in British accent]
"I can’t let you go."

[KELLY]
And I’m like "Ew, you’re my dad’s age." And then he makes me listen to his musical. And I’m like "what’s with the ship? Why are we building a ship?" But I never find out because I am literally bored to death

[SAM]
It was scandalous

[KELLY]
But not compared to...

[SAM (KELLY)]
The number one way (Number one way)

[KELLY]
Hit by a car on the way home from the library!
[SAM]
Kelly...

[KELLY]
If only I’d never cracked open a book

[SAM]
Shut up!

[KELLY]
Fine. Not ready to face your demons? Go ahead, sit in that memory swirl for a while

[Memory swirl, overlapping voices]
?== Simple as That
[SAM]
Adam likes tacos and playing board games

[ADAM]
Sam kicks my ass at Xbox
Call it wasting time

[SAM]
Call it immature

[ADAM]
You're just jealous 'cause it rocks

[SAM]
For sure
He's the perfect guy for a girl like me

[ADAM]
How much perfecter could a girlfriend be?

[SAM & ADAM]
Play a game, eat some food
Then make out when we're in the mood

[SAM]
It's as simple as peas in a peapod
[ADAM]
We fit like legos

[SAM & ADAM]
We like a candy deep fried

[ADAM]
We're like Bill and...

[SAM]
Ted

[ADAM]
Beavis and...

[SAM]
Butthead. I'm the Bonnie to his...

[ADAM]
Who?

[SAM]
Clyde

[ADAM]
Huh...
She's the perfect girl for a guy like me
[SAM]
How much more perfect could a boyfriend be?

[SAM & ADAM]
Play a game, eat some food
Then make out when we're in the mood
It's as simple as that
?== The Proposal
[ADAM]
Have sex with me
Have sex with me
In my room, I have a pack of condoms
I have scented candles, and I have a bed
Have sex with me
This one's autumn potpourri

[ADAM (SAM)]
Just sleep with me (What should I do?)
Please, sleep with me (Should I have sex with you?)
I will make you pancakes in the morning

[BEVERLY]
Pancakes are good

[ADAM]
And I’ll make you breakfast in bed
Won’t you please have sex with me
I make great Darjeeling tea

[ADAM (SAM)]
Hunger makes the timid bold (I can feel the hunger)
Feel your carnal urges (feel your carnal urges)
Taking hold (taking hold)
Let me say so I'm understood
Sex is good (Sex is good)
[KELLY]
So good

[ADAM (ENSEMBLE)]
Emberace your destiny (destiny)
Obey me, don't deny my hungry plea

[ADAM (SAM)]
Have sex with me (What should I do?)
Have sex with me (Should I have sex with you?)
Maybe not today, maybe tomorrow

[ENSEMBLE]
Have sex tomorrow

[ADAM]
Maybe not tomorrow, maybe in a week
Have sex with me, yeah
And your dinner will be free

[ENSEMBLE]
Have sex with me

[ADAM]
Have sex with me, yeah
?== There Was a Party
[KELLY]
What?
You think it’s gonna bite?

[SAM, spoken]
A starry sky. A club beat. We were visiting the one school we both gotten into. Where was Kelly? The beat got louder. I was pushing through crowds in a stairwell of this dorm or frat. Everyone was yelling. I didn’t stop to memorize the details. I didn’t know how much the night would matter. I opened a door

[SAM]
There was a party
A DJ
A beat pulsed on
A college
A campus
A manicured lawn
I waited for Kelly 'cause she was my ride
I had combed the whole dancefloor and wandered out... side the party
Or hallway
And it was, and it was
April and chilly
Or late March and warm
Our tour guide and Kelly
Were back at his dorm
The whole sky was spinning
I might have been drunk
As I steadied myself on the roof of her... trunk
All alone, was I lost, or was I alive
In this space, in the hole she created
No anchor
Abandoned
I waited
?== The Mad Ones
[KELLY, spoken]
Tell me the part about the candles

[SAM]
Uh...

[KELLY, spoken]
Do not pretend you don't have it memorized

[SAM, spoken]
The only ones for me are the mad ones. Mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time

[KELLY]
If we’re gonna go, we gotta go tonight...

[SAM, spoken]
The ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars...

[KELLY]
Oh...
If we're gonna go, we gotta go tonight
Go tonight
Go tonight
I'm in!

[SAM, spoken]
For what?
[KELLY]
We’re taking the risk
We're the fools who will never learn
Pushed to the edge, out on the ledge
Will you die out or burn, burn, burn?
Don't ask if you can
No, that's a mistake girls make
'Cause those good old boys
They had their good old days
But now they're gone, and now their world
Is ours to take...
We're mad to go
Mad to drive
Mad to be alive
We're chasing stars
A thousand suns
The mad... mad ones
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

We make the rules
We make a vow to be mad
Girl, we’re what matter now
Okay, first thing’s first, you have to go tell that TA I'm not coming back

[SAM, spoken]
What?

[KELLY]
If we’re gonna go, we gotta go tonight
Screw it, he'll figure it out
If we're gonna go, we gotta go tonight
Where are my keys?
[SAM, spoken]
Just calm down, there's planning involved. What are we living on, who’s paying our cell phone bills?

[KELLY, spoken]
Well, A...

[SAM, spoken]
Kelly!

[KELLY]
And two, Sam
If we're gonna go, we gotta go tonight
Go tonight

Stop saying 'can't'!

Stop telling me what to do!

If we're gonna go, we gotta go tonight
If we're gonna go, we gotta go tonight

[SAM]
If we're gonna go, we gotta go tonight

[KELLY & SAM]
Go tonight
Go tonight...

Without any plan
Just the keys and the radio

[KELLY]
Yeah!

[KELLY & SAM]
Living for us
Kicking up dust

[SAM]
We just pick up and go, go, go

[KELLY, screaming]
YEAH!

[SAM]
It's never or now

[KELLY]
Never or now, yes!

[KELLY & SAM]
Time to take your foot off the brake...

[SAM]
Yeah, those good old boys
They had their good old days

[KELLY & SAM]
But now they're gone
And now their world

But we didn't go, didn't go
Go that night
Did we?

[KELLY]
No, we didn't go, didn't go
Go that night

[SAM]
I mean, obviously
The whole thing went south
Per usual, Kelly's only plan was running her mouth

[KELLY]
Oh, but who let down who?

[SAM]
Who let down who?

[KELLY]
Who let down who?

[SAM]
Who let down who?

[KELLY]
You were the one who put on the brakes

[SAM]
I wanted to graduate first

[KELLY]
You didn't have what it takes

[SAM]
Oh, who let down who?

[KELLY]
Who let down who?

[SAM]
Like you ever follow through on a single word you say

[KELLY]
If we'd only go that night
Then I wouldn't be dead

[KELLY & SAM]
Tell me...

[SAM]
Who let down who?

[KELLY]
Who let down who?

?== I Know My Girl
[BEVERLY]
Eighteen years have come and gone
I raised my daughter well
Eighteen years she's my whole life
And now it goes to Hell
I know my girl and I know her eyes
And she never runs and she never lies
There’s something wrong, it's plain to see
Cause her head's a mess and her heart’s a whirl
I know those eyes
I know my girl
And she's gonna talk to me
I made cookies
Have a cookie

[SAM]
I have a test to study for

[BEVERLY]
I made cookies

[ADAM]
I like cookies

[BEVERLY]
Have a cookie. Have a few
And then you'll sit and talk
We'll sit and talk
You'll tell me who she's hanging out with
And who she's in a fight with
And why she isn't telling me
Has she started huffing?
Or did you get her pregnant?
Or is she high on LSD?
[SAM] (off stage)
Adam!

[ADAM]
I dunno. Maybe she’s having her... y’know

[BEVERLY]
I won't be discouraged
I refuse to be outdone
The game is far from over
Hell, it’s only just begun
I know my girl and I know her eyes
And she never runs and she never lies
I know she's dying to let me in
But her head's a mess and her heart's a whirl
I know those eyes, I know my girl
So let the games begin
Do you need to go into the CVS for something?

[SAM]
No. Why?

[BEVERLY]
You might need to go into the CVS for something?

[SAM]
Do you think I need to go into CVS?
[BEVERLY]
And if you need to go into the CVS for something
I could come along
I’ll help you buy the something...
Teach you to use the something...
Do you need to go into the CVS for something…
Anything...
Help me

[SAM]
She's trying to kill me
Is she trying to kill me?

[ADAM]
I dunno...
Maybe she's having her... y'know

[SAM]
Period, Period, Period, Period, Period!

[BEVERLY]
I made cookies

[SAM]
Oh! Nice
[BEVERLY]
Have a cookie

[ADAM]
Dude - it's a trap

[BEVERLY]
Just one cookie
Oh wait!
No more cookies
You waited too long
Now the cookies are gone
Sam, you have to eat cookies
While I'm still alive
To make you cookies
My mother made me cookies
We would talk through the night
She made everything right
I'm so happy I ate cookies
With my devoted mother, my guide
Before she died

[SAM] (to audience)
I was trapped

[KELLY] (to audience)
She was trapped
?== Miles to Go
[BEVERLY]
A lone boy on the highway
A future undefined
The rebel soul that got away and left his past behind
A lone boy on the highway
You've seen his face before
Two paths diverged and you went right
But he's left wanting more
And where he'll land
This town will never know-
He's got miles and miles and miles to go

His shoes that pound the pavement
The daydream he can't name
Now make that boy a lonely girl
And tell me she's the same
The boy you call a rebel
The girl— she's running scared
Cause any girl who's on her own
Is out there unprepared
She looks away
She keeps her profile low
She's got miles and miles and miles to go

The game has been rigged but I learned to play
And I'm not the enemy. I paved the way
I stood in my own mother's kitchen
The door slammed behind me
I blink and I'm you again-
I'm singing Janis Joplin at the top of my lungs
I'm cursing like a sailor and I'm speaking in tongues
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

A lone boy on the highway
You think "that could be me."
But you were born a woman and you'll never be that free
The glass cracks in the ceiling and women swell with pride
But when a woman breaks the rules
The world's not on her side
The wheels of change
They move so goddamn slow
Yes, we've come miles and miles and miles...

But we've got miles
And miles
And miles and miles
And miles and miles
And miles
To go
?== Say the Word
[SAM]
Sometimes when I look at you
I don't know why you'd wait
School girl in a little world
Who learns everything late
I've always had all the answers
Now I don't have a clue

Some nights when the clouds are thick
And the wind starts to blow
I stare out my window
Wondering where I will go
I turn the light out
Under the covers all I think of is you
Just you

Say the word
And I just might listen
Say the word
And you might get your way
Let me go if it's easier
But say the word
And I might have to stay

Meanwhile there's so many things
That we don't understand
I don't know why I tremble
When you reach for my hand
I didn't know how to love
Until you swept me away
So say the word
And I just might listen
Say the word
And you might get your way
Let me go if it's easier
But say the word
And I might have to stay

I wanna love
I wanna ride
I want to be the girl
There by your side
Just tell me when
Just tell me how
Tell me I'm ready now
Today

Say the word

[ADAM]
Say the word

[SAM]
And I just might listen

[ADAM]
Say the word
[SAM]
Say the word
And you might get your way

[ADAM]
Whatever you say

[SAM]
Let me go if it's easier
But say the word
And I might have to stay
?== Moving On
[KELLY, spoken]
Sam?
Don't you think you should wake up and answer the phone?

[SAM, spoken]
No

[KELLY, spoken]
Sam, you have to

[SAM]
What if I don't?

[KELLY, spoken]
What do you mean, what if you don't?

[SAM]
What if I don't?

[KELLY, spoken]
You did

[SAM]
But if I don't pick up the phone
It's sort of like it never happened
[KELLY, spoken]
What are you talking about?

[SAM]
Like the phone call
Never happened
And everything is normal
Including...

[KELLY, spoken]
Oh!

[SAM]
Right

[KELLY]
If you like don't pick up the phone
It's so like nothing ever happened

[SAM, spoken]
Then...

[KELLY, spoken]
Yeah

[KELLY]
I'm alive
[SAM]
You're alive

[KELLY, spoken]
Now that I'm alive we're doing this senior year my way
Just try to keep up with me, Brown!
[sung]
Oh, we're moving on
'Cause nothing else is standing in our way
Stay focused on the present

[SAM]
We're moving fast

[KELLY]
And if it's lame we're blowing right past
[spoken]
So what happened first?

[SAM, spoken]
I woke up at Adam's the next morning

[ADAM, spoken]
Sam... last night was...

[KELLY, spoken]
Blah, blah, blah, kiss, kiss, kiss
[sung]
Moving on
[SAM]
Moving on

[KELLY]
You're moving on

[SAM]
I'm moving on

[KELLY & SAM]
Oh, we're moving on

[BEVERLY, spoken]
Samantha, did you have sex?

[SAM, spoken]
Mom! I, um...

[KELLY, spoken]
Did Sam tell you that she picked a college?

[BEVERLY, spoken]
You did?

[SAM, spoken]
I did?

[KELLY, spoken]
Columbia

[SAM, spoken]
Really?

[KELLY, spoken]
Broad City

[SAM, spoken]
Genius

[KELLY]
Columbia

[BEVERLY]
Columbia

[KELLY & BEVERLY]
Columbia

[SAM]
Columbia

[BEVERLY]
Columbia

[KELLY & BEVERLY]
Roar, lions, roar

[SAM]
Oh, I'm moving on
And senior prom is right around the bend

[KELLY]
You'll need a strapless bra

[SAM, spoken]
Duh

[KELLY & SAM]
Then to the spa
Pedicures for the prom
On mom
My toes are getting tingly

[ADAM]
Tingly!

[KELLY & SAM]
Dee-dee dee-dee
We're moving on

[BEVERLY]
Senior prom
Only one senior prom
It's your senior prom
Beautiful lights
Beautiful night
Right for a senior prom
Oh, oh
Senior prom, senior prom
Oh, oh
Oh, glittering disco ball
Strangers fall
No, nothing like a senior prom, senior prom
Senior prom

[ADAM, spoken]
Hey Kelly

[KELLY, spoken]
Hey Adam

[ADAM, spoken]
Hey... Sting

[BEVERLY, as Sting]
Every Breath I Take is about how people want to make out
And Sting makes out until dawn

[KELLY]
We're moving on

[SAM, spoken]
Let's get out of here!

[KELLY, spoken]
Road trip!

[SAM]
With Kelly driving nothing's fate

[KELLY]
Hot boys, turn right
It's not a drill

[SAM]
How does she never even hesitate

[KELLY]
Let's give them a little thrill
[spoken]
How do you like these

[SAM]
It's all a dream

[KELLY, spoken]
Arby's!

[SAM]
It's all so clear

[KELLY]
Gotta eat this, can you steer?

[SAM]
In our plain

[KELLY, spoken]
Oh my God, this is amazing

[SAM]
Dull

[KELLY, spoken]
Watch out for that semi

[SAM]
Normal, good, simple, nothing much, beautiful, ordinary
Ordinary senior year
[spoken]
This has been an ordinary senior year for most of us
School dances, a lot of tests, a couple road trips, and some of us even fell in love
But the thing that has made my senior year extraordinary is that I've had my best friend Kelly to share it with

[SAM]
Oh, we say goodbye

[KELLY]
So say goodbye

[SAM]
We say goodbye to high school

[KELLY & SAM]
And face the world

[SAM]
Though we don't know what we'll see there
We know that we'll be there

[KELLY & SAM]
Together
It's time to kick some ass

[KELLY]
For all you lowerclassmen, sucks for you

[SAM]
Peace out to

[KELLY & SAM]
All our crew

[SAM]
The party's gone

[KELLY & SAM]
We're moving on
?== Go Tonight
[KELLY]
If we're gonna go we gotta go tonight, go tonight, go tonight
If we're gonna go we gotta go tonight, go tonight, go tonight

[SAM]
She was, she was
Sitting on the roof of her beat up car
Half singing, half laughing, half going too far
The music played over, with nothing to come
In a remix of memories, the loop of the... drum
Or bass line, or was it

[KELLY]
If we're gonna go we gotta go tonight, go tonight, go tonight
If we're gonna go we gotta go tonight, go tonight, go tonight

[SAM]
She was, she was
Everything I'm not, my whole universe
And I was a footnote, a slim second verse
But she was the chorus, the hook and the groove
And without her there pushing, somehow I can't... move

So I sit in the car that she left behind
Sinking down in this void like a crater
Getting lost in a world that I can't rewind
It's too late and it's just getting later
[KELLY (SAM)]
If we're gonna go we gotta go tonight, go tonight (Why did I say no?)
If we're gonna go, we gotta go tonight (We had miles to go), go

[SAM]
You were mad to reach
Mad to drive

[SAM & KELLY]
Mad
Mad

[SAM]
And so alive
The space you left
The empty air
I reach

[SAM & KELLY]
Reach

[SAM]
But you're not there
And time expands
The beat goes on
You were mad, mad
And now you're...
She was...
She was...
[SAM & KELLY]
Oh

[SAM (KELLY)]
(Oh) Over and over
Your words to me echo (Go tonight, go tonight)
(Oh) Over and over
As I try to let go

[SAM]
There's a black hole
A vacuum in deep outer space
That swallows all matter
Without any trace
Where life is suspended
In physics and time
Every word you said
Hangs like an unfinished... rhyme

[SAM (KELLY)]
So I sit in the vacuum you left behind
And I sift through each phrase for an ember (Go)
For a spark that will light
'Cause I can't rewind
I unravel until I remember
[SAM]
Sitting on the roof
Of your beat up car
When I was your orbit
And you were my star
But now you're a black hole
And I am left numb
From the loop of these memories
The loop of the
The loop of the
The loop of the
?== Yellow SUV
[SAM, spoken]
If a yellow SUV is traveling down at Elmwood Road with a constant velocity of 57 miles per hour... and a pedestrian is crossing the road at 2.5 miles per hour... if the football player driving the SUV sees the pedestrian from a distance of 132 feet and slams on the brake, decelerating at a rate of 11.1 miles per hour per second, will the SUV still hit the pedestrian? Yes. But only if she hears him coming, only if she slows down just enough to look up... It takes two seconds... I know that. What I didn't know is that time doesn't stop. Prom still has a theme, the valedictorian still gives a speech on a future she knows nothing about. The truth is, I don't remember any of it. Not one slow dance or test, not one single day of that spring. Nothing woke me up, nothing moved me, except one thing. It was yesterday
?== Run Away With Me
Let me catch my breath
This is really hard
If I start to look like I'm sweating, well
That's 'cause I am

I'm not good with words
But that's nothing new
Still, I have to try to explain what I want to do
With you
With you

Run away with me
Let me be your ride out of town
Let me be the place that you hide
We can make our lives on the go
Run away with me
Texas in the summer is cool
We'll be on the road like Jack Kerouac
Lookin' back
Sam, you're ready
Let's go
Anywhere
Get the car packed and throw me the key
Run away with me

Sam, I know it's fast
I'm in love with you
Sam, it's crazy but Sam, I'm crazier for you
I have these plans
Sam, I have these plans
Of a house that we build on a bay
When we run away
Let me be your ride out of town
Let me be the place that you hide
We can make our lives on the go
Run away with me
Alabama heat, sign me up
We'll be on the road like some country song
Won't be long
Sam, you're ready
Let's go
Anywhere
Get the car packed and throw me the key
Run away with me

I'm not trying to make you a wife here
I'm not trying to tie you down
I'm just saying there might be a life here
A new one as soon as we run

Run away with me
Mississippi mud, watch me slide
We'll be on the road like Jack Kerouac
Lookin' back
Sam, you're ready, Sam

Let me be your ride out of town
Run away with me
California dreams, here we come!
Romeo is calling for Juliet
Ready, set
Sam, you're ready
Let's go
Anywhere
Say the word and I'm already there!
?== Drive
[BEVERLY]
Okay, buckle up
I’ll be administering your test today
If you follow my instructions, you won’t die
If you follow my instructions, you won’t fail
Do you wanna die, do you wanna fail?

[SAM]
No

[BEVERLY]
Watch for traffic

[SAM]
Watch for traffic

[BEVERLY]
Don’t forget to breathe

[SAM]
Don’t forget to breathe

[BEVERLY]
Just keep it steady

[SAM]
Okay
[BEVERLY]
Relax
Drive

[SAM]
Drive

[BEVERLY]
So

[SAM]
Eyes ahead
Focus and steer
Don’t look in the rearview mirror
Don’t think
Don’t swerve
Don’t stop

[KELLY]
Drive

[SAM]
Just keep it simple

[KELLY]
Drive
[SAM]
Keep the speed 55

[KELLY]
Drive

[SAM]
Breathe and watch the highway

[KELLY]
Drive

[SAM]
Focus and drive

[KELLY]
Okay, buckle up

[SAM]
Kelly, stop!

[KELLY]
I’ll be administering your test today
If you follow my instructions, I can free you
I can make you feel alive
[SAM]
I can do it on my own

[BEVERLY]
Eighteen years have come and gone

[KELLY]
Drive

[SAM]
Drive

[BEVERLY]
Eighteen years, you’re my whole life!

[KELLY]
Watch for traffic

[SAM]
Watch for traffic

[KELLY]
Don’t forget to breathe

[SAM]
Don’t forget to breathe

[KELLY]
Just keep it steady, okay?

[SAM]
Okay
Drive

[BEVERLY, overlapping]
I know my girl
If you follow my instructions

[KELLY, overlapping]
Follow my instructions

[SAM, overlapping]
Eyes ahead
Focus and steer
Don’t look in the rearview mirror
Don’t think
Don’t swerve
Don’t stop

[ADAM, overlapping]
Okay, buckle up
I’ll be administering your test today
If you follow my instructions, I’ll keep you safe
Take the next exit and drive

[SAM]
I don’t wanna be safe

[KELLY]
You wanna take a risk?

[SAM]
Yes!

[BEVERLY]
Risk is good if it’s planned

[SAM]
I don’t wanna plan

[BEVERLY]
Calculate the risk you’re taking

[KELLY]
Buckle up

[BEVERLY]
Calculate a short equation

[SAM]
I want to drive…

[KELLY]
The road you take should feel right…

[BEVERLY]
Multiply threat

[KELLY, overlapping]
The road will tell you who you are

[BEVERLY, overlapping]
Multiply threat
By vulnerability, by cost

[ADAM]
Sam, you’re ready, let’s go
Maybe not today, maybe tomorrow

[ADAM, overlapping]
Maybe, it’s as simple as California dreams

[BEVERLY, overlapping]
I love-

[KELLY, overlapping]
I love-

[ADAM, overlapping]
Romeo and Juliet
It’s as simple as that

[KELLY & BEVERLY, overlapping]
I love-

[ADAM, overlapping]
Sam, I know it’s fast

[KELLY & BEVERLY, overlapping]
I love you

[ADAM, overlapping]
I’m in love with you

[SAM, spoken]
What do I want? What do I need? It doesn’t matter if it’s a mistake

[BEVERLY]
Slow down, Sam

[SAM, spoken]
It doesn’t matter if I fail. I have to think big

[KELLY]
Remember

[SAM, spoken]
I have to take control

[ADAM]
Run away with me

[SAM, overlapping]
Even if I disappoint everyone. Even if no one ever speaks to me again. I have to feel something

[BEVERLY, overlapping]
Slow down, Sam

[KELLY, overlapping]
Remember

[ADAM, overlapping]
It's as simple as that

[ADAM & KELLY, overlapping]
Let’s go

[BEVERLY, overlapping]
Slow

[SAM]
Listen to me!
I never dreamed of running away
But I do dream about the highway
I start driving and keep driving
I can’t stop 'til I feel alive again
Feel alive on my own
And I wish I could say that you’re with me
But I know I’m alone

[KELLY]
Remember

[ADAM]
Hey, Sam

[KELLY]
Remember

[BEVERLY]
I will let you go

[SAM]
Eyes ahead
Focus and steer
Don’t look in the rearview mirror
Don’t think
Don’t swerve
Don’t stop
?== I Didn’t Say Goodbye
[KELLY]
You passed

[SAM]
I can’t do this alone

[KELLY]
You’re scared. You should be. If you’re not, you’re not doing it right. You do it now, you do it for you, and you do it alone. Be mad, Sam. Be careless and wild and squeeze the life out of every second. And do not crash my car. I’m serious. I will like haunt you

[SAM]
You’re the kind of person who would do this. Not me

[KELLY]
You take the risk
You pay the cost
You drive
Until you're lost
And look around
See where you went
And your life
Will be a monument

[SAM]
So what? Just get the atlas out and point?

[KELLY]
Ugh, what did I always tell you?
[SAM]
I don’t remember

[KELLY]
Yeah, you do

[SAM]
Maps are for brain-deads?

[KELLY]
That’s right

[SAM]
I didn’t say goodbye

[KELLY]
Sometimes, you don’t get to say goodbye

[SAM]
I really miss you

[KELLY]
I know. It sucks, right?

[SAM]
Can’t we just stay like this?
[KELLY]
You know we can’t

[SAM]
Just for a little while longer?

[KELLY]
What do you want Sam?

[SAM]
I want the deafening sound of driving fast with the windows down. I want to reach the horizon of impossibility

[KELLY]
I live in what you do
In what you want to do
Now that I’m gone

[SAM]
I’m moving on
?== Remember This
[SAM]
The seat is sinking underneath your weight
The sky is pale with morning light
Your heart is beating at a faster rate
Remember this
The racing heart, the faded dawn
Remember this
Before the moment’s gone

[SAM & KELLY]
The street is quiet but the clouds race by

[SAM]
And who knows what those clouds will see

[SAM & BEVERLY]
Before you start regretting

[BEVERLY]
Before you

[SAM]
Before you

[SAM & BEVERLY]
Turn the key
[SAM]
Remember this
The way it feels inside the car

[ALL]
The still cool air

[SAM]
Remember feeling like your life begins today
Try to stop and feel each second slip away
Remember this

[ALL]
Remember

[BEVERLY]
Remember everything that led you here

[KELLY]
Each road trip and every single tear

[ALL]
Remember what you've learned

[SAM]
And what you still don’t know
[ALL]
You look back on your life

[SAM]
On the girl you were for eighteen years

[ALL ]
You look back one more time

[SAM]
Then you let it go

[ALL]
Your hand might shake as the ignition lights
You might not know what road you’ll take

[BEVERLY]
But now

[ALL]
But now the gear is shifting
Your foot is lifting off the brake
Remember this

[SAM]
Remember
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
[ALL]
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
